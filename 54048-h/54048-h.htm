vii</span>ADVERTISEMENT.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">(1857.)</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> having been frequently stated in
print that the book called <i>Lavengro</i> was got up expressly
against the popish agitation in the years 1850&ndash;51, the
author takes this opportunity of saying that the principal part
of that book was written in the year &rsquo;43, that the whole of
it was completed before the termination of the year &rsquo;46,
and that it was in the hands of the publisher in the year
&rsquo;48. <a name="citation0a"></a><a href="#footnote0a"
class="citation">[0a]</a>&nbsp; And here he cannot forbear
observing, that it was the duty of that publisher to have
rebutted a statement which he knew to be a calumny; and also to
have set the public right on another point dealt with in the
Appendix to the present work, more especially as he was the
proprietor of a Review enjoying, however undeservedly, a certain
sale and reputation.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But take your
own part, boy!<br />
For if you don&rsquo;t, no one will take it for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With respect to <i>Lavengro</i>, the author feels that he has
no reason to be ashamed of it.&nbsp; In writing that book he did
his duty, by pointing out to his country-people the nonsense
which, to the greater part of them, is as the breath of their
nostrils, and which, if indulged in, as it probably will be, to
the same extent as hitherto, will, within a very few years, bring
the land which he most loves beneath a foreign yoke&mdash;he does
not here allude to the yoke of Rome.</p>
<p>Instead of being ashamed, has he not rather cause to be proud
of a book which has had the honour of being rancorously abused
and execrated by the very people of whom the country has least
reason to be proud? <a name="citation0b"></a><a
href="#footnote0b" class="citation">[0b]</a></p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><p><a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
viii</span>&ldquo;One day Cogia Efendy went to a bridal
festival.&nbsp; The masters of the feast, observing his old and
coarse apparel, paid him no consideration whatever.&nbsp; The
Cogia saw that he had no chance of notice; so going out, he
hurried to his house, and, putting on a splendid pelisse,
returned to the place of festival.&nbsp; No sooner did he enter
the door than the masters advanced to meet him, and saying,
&lsquo;Welcome, Cogia Efendy,&rsquo; with all imaginable honour
and reverence, placed him at the head of the table, and said,
&lsquo;Please to eat, Lord Cogia&rsquo;.&nbsp; Forthwith the
Cogia, taking hold of one of the furs of his pelisse, said,
&lsquo;Welcome my pelisse; please to eat, my lord&rsquo;.&nbsp;
The masters looking at the Cogia with great surprise, said,
&lsquo;What are you about?&rsquo;&nbsp; Whereupon the Cogia
replied, &lsquo;As it is quite evident that all the honour paid,
is paid to my pelisse, I think it ought to have some food
too&rsquo;.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pleasantries of the
Cogia Nasr Eddin Efendi</span>.</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAPTER
I.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">awoke</span> at the first break of day,
and, leaving the postillion fast asleep, stepped out of the
tent.&nbsp; The dingle was dank and dripping.&nbsp; I lighted a
fire of coals, and got my forge in readiness.&nbsp; I then
ascended to the field, where the chaise was standing as we had
left it on the previous evening.&nbsp; After looking at the
cloud-stone near it, now cold, and split into three pieces, I set
about prying narrowly into the condition of the wheel and
axle-tree.&nbsp; The latter had sustained no damage of any
consequence, and the wheel, as far as I was able to judge, was
sound, being only slightly injured in the box.&nbsp; The only
thing requisite to set the chaise in a travelling condition
appeared to be a linch-pin, which I determined to make.&nbsp;
Going to the companion wheel, I took out the linch-pin, which I
carried down with me to the dingle, to serve me as a model.</p>
<p>I found Belle by this time dressed, and seated near the
forge.&nbsp; With a slight nod to her like that which a person
gives who happens to see an acquaintance when his mind is
occupied with important business, I forthwith set about my
work.&nbsp; Selecting a piece of iron which I thought would serve
my purpose, I placed it in the fire, and plying the bellows in a
furious manner, soon made it hot; then seizing it with the tongs,
I laid it on the anvil, and began to beat it with my hammer,
according to the rules of my art.&nbsp; The dingle resounded with
my strokes.&nbsp; Belle sat still, and occasionally smiled, but
suddenly started up, and retreated towards her encampment, on a
spark which I purposely sent in her direction alighting on her
knee.&nbsp; I found the making of a linch-pin no easy matter; it
was, however, less difficult than the fabrication of a pony-shoe;
my work, indeed, was much facilitated by my having another pin to
look at.&nbsp; In about three-quarters <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>of an hour I had succeeded tolerably
well, and had produced a linch-pin which I thought would
serve.&nbsp; During all this time, notwithstanding the noise
which I was making, the postillion never showed his face.&nbsp;
His non-appearance at first alarmed me: I was afraid he might be
dead, but, on looking into the tent, I found him still buried in
the soundest sleep.&nbsp; &ldquo;He must surely be descended from
one of the seven sleepers,&rdquo; said I, as I turned away, and
resumed my work.&nbsp; My work finished, I took a little oil,
leather and sand, and polished the pin as well as I could; then,
summoning Belle, we both went to the chaise, where, with her
assistance, I put on the wheel.&nbsp; The linch-pin which I had
made fitted its place very well, and having replaced the other, I
gazed at the chaise for some time with my heart full of that
satisfaction which results from the consciousness of having
achieved a great action; then, after looking at Belle in the hope
of obtaining a compliment from her lips, which did not come, I
returned to the dingle, without saying a word, followed by
her.&nbsp; Belle set about making preparations for breakfast; and
I taking the kettle went and filled it at the spring.&nbsp;
Having hung it over the fire, I went to the tent in which the
postillion was still sleeping, and called upon him to
arise.&nbsp; He awoke with a start, and stared around him at
first with the utmost surprise, not unmixed, I could observe,
with a certain degree of fear.&nbsp; At last, looking in my face,
he appeared to recollect himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had quite
forgot,&rdquo; said he, as he got up, &ldquo;where I was, and all
that happened yesterday.&nbsp; However, I remember now the whole
affair, thunder-storm, thunder-bolt, frightened horses, and all
your kindness.&nbsp; Come, I must see after my coach and horses;
I hope we shall be able to repair the damage.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The damage is already quite repaired,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;as you will see, if you come to the field
above.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so,&rdquo; said
the postillion, coming out of the tent; &ldquo;well, I am
mightily beholden to you.&nbsp; Good-morning, young
gentlewoman,&rdquo; said he, addressing Belle, who, having
finished her preparations was seated near the fire.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good morning, young man,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;I
suppose you would be glad of some breakfast; however, you must
wait a little, the kettle does not boil.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come
and look at your chaise,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but tell me how it
happened that the noise which I have been making did not awake
you; for three-quarters of an hour at least I was hammering close
at your ear.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I heard you all the time,&rdquo;
said the postillion, &ldquo;but your hammering made me sleep all
the sounder; I am used to hear hammering in my morning
sleep.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a forge close by the room where I
sleep when <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>I&rsquo;m at home, at my inn; for we have all kinds of
conveniences at my inn&mdash;forge, carpenter&rsquo;s shop, and
wheelwright&rsquo;s&mdash;so that when I heard you hammering I
thought, no doubt, that it was the old noise, and that I was
comfortable in my bed at my own inn.&rdquo;&nbsp; We now ascended
to the field, where I showed the postillion his chaise.&nbsp; He
looked at the pin attentively, rubbed his hands, and gave a loud
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it not well done?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It will do till I get home,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And that is all you have to say?&rdquo; I demanded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s a good deal,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;considering who made it.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t be
offended,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I shall prize it all the more
for its being made by a gentleman, and no blacksmith; and so will
my governor, when I show it to him.&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t let it
remain where it is, but will keep it, as a remembrance of you, as
long as I live.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then again rubbed his hands with
great glee, and said: &ldquo;I will now go and see after my
horses, and then to breakfast, partner, if you
please&rdquo;.&nbsp; Suddenly, however, looking at his hands, he
said, &ldquo;Before sitting down to breakfast I am in the habit
of washing my hands and face; I suppose you could not furnish me
with a little soap and water&rdquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;As much water
as you please,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but if you want soap, I must
go and trouble the young gentlewoman for some.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;water will
do at a pinch.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; said I, and
leading him to the pond of the frogs and newts, I said,
&ldquo;this is my ewer; you are welcome to part of it&mdash;the
water is so soft that it is scarcely necessary to add soap to
it;&rdquo; then lying down on the bank, I plunged my head into
the water, then scrubbed my hands and face, and afterwards wiped
them with some long grass which grew on the margin of the
pond.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bravo,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;I
see you know how to make a shift&rdquo;: he then followed my
example, declared he never felt more refreshed in his life, and,
giving a bound, said, &ldquo;he would go and look after his
horses&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We then went to look after the horses, which we found not much
the worse for having spent the night in the open air.&nbsp; My
companion again inserted their heads in the corn-bags, and,
leaving the animals to discuss their corn, returned with me to
the dingle, where we found the kettle boiling.&nbsp; We sat down,
and Belle made tea, and did the honours of the meal.&nbsp; The
postillion was in high spirits, ate heartily, and, to
Belle&rsquo;s evident satisfaction, declared that he had never
drank better tea in his life, or indeed any half so good.&nbsp;
Breakfast over, he said that he must now go and harness his
horses, as it was high time for him to return to his inn.&nbsp;
Belle gave him her hand and wished him <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>farewell.&nbsp; The postillion shook
her hand warmly, and was advancing close up to her&mdash;for what
purpose I cannot say&mdash;whereupon Belle, withdrawing her hand,
drew herself up with an air which caused the postillion to
retreat a step or two with an exceedingly sheepish look.&nbsp;
Recovering himself, however, he made a low bow, and proceeded up
the path.&nbsp; I attended him, and helped to harness his horses
and put them to the vehicle; he then shook me by the hand, and
taking the reins and whip mounted to his seat; ere he drove away
he thus addressed me: &ldquo;If ever I forget your kindness and
that of the young woman below, dash my buttons.&nbsp; If ever
either of you should enter my inn you may depend upon a warm
welcome, the best that can be set before you, and no expense to
either, for I will give both of you the best of characters to the
governor, who is the very best fellow upon all the road.&nbsp; As
for your linch-pin, I trust it will serve till I get home, when I
will take it out and keep it in remembrance of you all the days
of my life&rdquo;: then giving the horses a jerk with his reins,
he cracked his whip and drove off.</p>
<p>I returned to the dingle, Belle had removed the breakfast
things, and was busy in her own encampment.&nbsp; Nothing
occurred, worthy of being related, for two hours, at the end of
which time Belle departed on a short expedition, and I again
found myself alone in the dingle.</p>
<h2><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>CHAPTER
II.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the evening I received another
visit from the man in black.&nbsp; I had been taking a stroll in
the neighbourhood, and was sitting in the dingle in rather a
listless manner, scarcely knowing how to employ myself; his
coming, therefore, was by no means disagreeable to me.&nbsp; I
produced the Hollands and glass from my tent, where Isopel
Berners had requested me to deposit them, and also some lump
sugar, then taking the gotch I fetched water from the spring,
and, sitting down, begged the man in black to help himself; he
was not slow in complying with my desire, and prepared for
himself a glass of Hollands and water with a lump of sugar in
it.&nbsp; After he had taken two or three sips with evident
satisfaction, I, remembering his chuckling exclamation of
&ldquo;Go to Rome for money,&rdquo; when he last left the dingle,
took the liberty, after a little conversation, of reminding him
of it, whereupon, with a he! he! he! he replied: &ldquo;Your idea
was not quite so original as I supposed.&nbsp; After leaving you
the other night, I remembered having read of an Emperor of
Germany who conceived the idea of applying to Rome for money, and
actually put it into practice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Urban the Eighth then occupied the papal chair, of the
family of the Barbarini, nicknamed the <i>Mosche</i>, or Flies,
from the circumstance of bees being their armorial bearing.&nbsp;
The Emperor having exhausted all his money in endeavouring to
defend the Church against Gustavus Adolphus, the great King of
Sweden, who was bent on its destruction, applied in his necessity
to the Pope for a loan of money.&nbsp; The Pope, however, and his
relations, whose cellars were at that time full of the money of
the Church, which they had been plundering for years, refused to
lend him a scudo; whereupon a pasquinade picture was stuck up at
Rome, representing the Church lying on a bed, gashed with
dreadful wounds, and beset all over with flies, which were
sucking her, whilst the Emperor of Germany was kneeling before
her with a miserable face, requesting a little money towards
carrying on the war against the heretics, to which the poor
Church was made to say: &lsquo;How can I assist you, O my
champion, do you not see <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>that the flies have sucked me to the
very bones?&rsquo;&nbsp; Which story,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;shows that the idea of going to Rome for money was not
quite so original as I imagined the other night, though utterly
preposterous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This affair,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;occurred in what
were called the days of nepotism.&nbsp; Certain popes, who wished
to make themselves in some degree independent of the cardinals,
surrounded themselves with their nephews and the rest of their
family, who sucked the Church and Christendom as much as they
could, none doing so more effectually than the relations of Urban
the Eighth, at whose death, according to the book called the
<i>Nipotismo di Roma</i>, there were in the Barbarini family two
hundred and twenty-seven governments, abbeys and high dignities,
and so much hard cash in their possession, that three score and
ten mules were scarcely sufficient to convey the plunder of one
of them to Palestrina.&rdquo;&nbsp; He added, however, that it
was probable that Christendom fared better whilst the popes were
thus independent, as it was less sucked, whereas before and after
that period it was sucked by hundreds instead of tens, by the
cardinals and all their relations instead of by the Pope and his
nephews only.</p>
<p>Then, after drinking rather copiously of his Hollands, he said
that it was certainly no bad idea of the popes to surround
themselves with nephews, on whom they bestowed great Church
dignities, as by so doing they were tolerably safe from poison,
whereas a pope, if abandoned to the cardinals, might at any time
be made away with by them, provided they thought that he lived
too long, or that he seemed disposed to do anything which they
disliked; adding, that Ganganelli would never have been poisoned
provided he had had nephews about him to take care of his life,
and to see that nothing unholy was put into his food, or a
bustling stirring brother&rsquo;s wife like Donna Olympia.&nbsp;
He then with a he! he! he! asked me if I had ever read the book
called the <i>Nipotismo di Roma</i>, and on my replying in the
negative, he told me that it was a very curious and entertaining
book, which he occasionally looked at in an idle hour, and
proceeded to relate to me anecdotes out of the <i>Nipotismo di
Roma</i>, about the successor of Urban, Innocent the Tenth, and
Donna Olympia, showing how fond he was of her, and how she cooked
his food, and kept the cardinals away from it, and how she and
her creatures plundered Christendom, with the sanction of the
Pope, until Christendom, becoming enraged, insisted that he
should put her away, which he did for a time, putting a
nephew&mdash;one Camillo Astalli&mdash;in her place, in which,
however, he did not continue <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>long; for the Pope conceiving a pique
against him, banished him from his sight, and recalled Donna
Olympia, who took care of his food, and plundered Christendom
until Pope Innocent died.</p>
<p>I said that I only wondered that between pope and cardinals
the whole system of Rome had not long fallen to the ground, and
was told, in reply, that its not having fallen was the strongest
proof of its vital power, and the absolute necessity for the
existence of the system.&nbsp; That the system, notwithstanding
its occasional disorders, went on.&nbsp; Popes and cardinals
might prey upon its bowels, and sell its interests, but the
system survived.&nbsp; The cutting off of this or that member was
not able to cause Rome any vital loss; for, as soon as she lost a
member, the loss was supplied by her own inherent vitality;
though her popes had been poisoned by cardinals, and her
cardinals by popes; and though priests occasionally poisoned
popes, cardinals, and each other, after all that had been, and
might be, she had still, and would ever have, her priests,
cardinals and pope.</p>
<p>Finding the man in black so communicative and reasonable, I
determined to make the best of my opportunity, and learn from him
all I could with respect to the papal system, and told him that
he would particularly oblige me by telling me who the Pope of
Rome was; and received for answer, that he was an old man elected
by a majority of cardinals to the papal chair, who, immediately
after his election, became omnipotent and equal to God on
earth.&nbsp; On my begging him not to talk such nonsense, and
asking him how a person could be omnipotent who could not always
preserve himself from poison, even when fenced round by nephews,
or protected by a bustling woman, he, after taking a long sip of
Hollands and water, told me that I must not expect too much from
omnipotence; for example, that as it would be unreasonable to
expect that One above could annihilate the past&mdash;for
instance, the Seven Years&rsquo; War, or the French
Revolution&mdash;though any one who believed in Him would
acknowledge Him to be omnipotent, so would it be unreasonable for
the faithful to expect that the Pope could always guard himself
from poison.&nbsp; Then, after looking at me for a moment
stedfastly, and taking another sip, he told me that popes had
frequently done impossibilities; for example, Innocent the Tenth
had created a nephew; for, not liking particularly any of his
real nephews, he had created the said Camillo Astalli his nephew;
asking me, with a he! he! &ldquo;What but omnipotence could make
a young man nephew to a person to whom he was not in the
slightest degree related?&rdquo;&nbsp; On my observing that of
course no one believed that the young fellow <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>was really the
Pope&rsquo;s nephew, though the Pope might have adopted him as
such, the man in black replied, &ldquo;that the reality of the
nephewship of Camillo Astalli had hitherto never become a point
of faith; let, however, the present Pope, or any other Pope,
proclaim that it is necessary to believe in the reality of the
nephewship of Camillo Astalli, and see whether the faithful would
not believe in it.&nbsp; Who can doubt that,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;seeing that they believe in the reality of the five
propositions of Jansenius?&nbsp; The Jesuits, wishing to ruin the
Jansenists, induced a pope to declare that such and such damnable
opinions, which they called five propositions, were to be found
in a book written by Jansen, though, in reality, no such
propositions were to be found there; whereupon the existence of
these propositions became forthwith a point of faith to the
faithful.&nbsp; Do you then think,&rdquo; he demanded,
&ldquo;that there is one of the faithful who would not swallow,
if called upon, the nephewship of Camillo Astalli as easily as
the five propositions of Jansenius?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely,
then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the faithful must be a pretty pack of
simpletons!&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon the man in black exclaimed:
&ldquo;What! a Protestant, and an infringer of the rights of
faith!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a fellow who would feel himself
insulted if any one were to ask him how he could believe in the
miraculous conception, calling people simpletons who swallow the
five propositions of Jansenius, and are disposed, if called upon,
to swallow the reality of the nephewship of Camillo
Astalli.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was about to speak, when I was interrupted by the arrival of
Belle.&nbsp; After unharnessing her donkey, and adjusting her
person a little, she came and sat down by us.&nbsp; In the
meantime I had helped my companion to some more Hollands and
water, and had plunged with him into yet deeper discourse.</p>
<h2><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>CHAPTER
III.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> told the man in black that I
should like to know all the truth with regard to the Pope and his
system, he assured me he should be delighted to give me all the
information in his power; that he had come to the dingle, not so
much for the sake of the good cheer which I was in the habit of
giving him, as in the hope of inducing me to enlist under the
banners of Rome, and to fight in her cause; and that he had no
doubt that, by speaking out frankly to me, he ran the best chance
of winning me over.</p>
<p>He then proceeded to tell me that the experience of countless
ages had proved the necessity of religion; the necessity, he
would admit, was only for simpletons; but as nine-tenths of the
dwellers upon this earth were simpletons, it would never do for
sensible people to run counter to their folly, but, on the
contrary, it was their wisest course to encourage them in it,
always provided that, by so doing, sensible people could derive
advantage; that the truly sensible people of this world were the
priests, who, without caring a straw for religion for its own
sake, made use of it as a cord by which to draw the simpletons
after them; that there were many religions in this world, all of
which had been turned to excellent account by the priesthood; but
that the one the best adapted for the purposes of priestcraft was
the popish, which, he said, was the oldest in the world and the
best calculated to endure.&nbsp; On my inquiring what he meant by
saying the popish religion was the oldest in the world, whereas
there could be no doubt that the Greek and Roman religion had
existed long before it, to say nothing of the old Indian religion
still in existence and vigour, he said, with a nod, after taking
a sip at his glass, that, between me and him, the popish
religion, that of Greece and Rome, and the old Indian system
were, in reality, one and the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me that you intended to be frank,&rdquo; said
I; &ldquo;but, however frank you may be, I think you are rather
wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We priests of Rome,&rdquo; said the man in black,
&ldquo;even those amongst us who do not go much abroad, know a
great deal about Church matters, of which you heretics have very
little idea.&nbsp; Those of our brethren of the Propaganda, on
their return home <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>from distant missions, not unfrequently tell us very
strange things relating to our dear mother; for example, our
first missionaries to the East were not slow in discovering and
telling to their brethren that our religion and the great Indian
one were identical, no more difference between them than between
Ram and Rome.&nbsp; Priests, convents, beads, prayers,
processions, fastings, penances, all the same, not forgetting
anchorites and vermin, he! he!&nbsp; The Pope they found under
the title of the grand lama, a sucking child surrounded by an
immense number of priests.&nbsp; Our good brethren, some two
hundred years ago, had a hearty laugh, which their successors
have often re-echoed; they said that helpless suckling and its
priests put them so much in mind of their own old man, surrounded
by his cardinals, he! he!&nbsp; Old age is second
childhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they find Christ?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They found him too,&rdquo; said the man in black,
&ldquo;that is, they saw his image; he is considered in India as
a pure kind of being, and on that account, perhaps, is kept there
rather in the background, even as he is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this is very mysterious to me,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;but
of this I am tolerably sure, and so are most of those of Rome,
that modern Rome had its religion from ancient Rome, which had
its religion from the East.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was brought about, I believe, by the wanderings of
nations,&rdquo; said the man in black.&nbsp; &ldquo;A brother of
the Propaganda, a very learned man, once told me&mdash;I do not
mean Mezzofanti, who has not five ideas&mdash;this brother once
told me that all we of the Old World, from Calcutta to Dublin,
are of the same stock, and were originally of the same language,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of one religion,&rdquo; I put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of one religion,&rdquo; said the man in black;
&ldquo;and now follow different modifications of the same
religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We Christians are not image-worshippers,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heretics are not, you mean,&rdquo; said the man in
black; &ldquo;but you will be put down, just as you have always
been, though others may rise up after you; the true religion is
image-worship; people may strive against it, but they will only
work themselves to an oil; how did it fare with that Greek
Emperor, the Iconoclast, what was his name, Leon the
Isaurian?&nbsp; Did not his image-breaking cost him Italy, the
fairest province of his empire, and did not ten fresh images
start up at home for every one which he <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>demolished?&nbsp; Oh! you little know the craving which
the soul sometimes feels after a good bodily image.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have indeed no conception of it,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;I have an abhorrence of idolatry&mdash;the idea of bowing
before a graven figure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea, indeed!&rdquo; said Belle, who had now joined
us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you never bow before that of Shakespeare?&rdquo;
said the man in black, addressing himself to me, after a low bow
to Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember that I ever did,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;but even suppose I did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you did,&rdquo; said the man in black;
&ldquo;shame on you, Mr. Hater of Idolatry; why, the very
supposition brings you to the ground; you must make figures of
Shakespeare, must you? then why not of St. Antonio, or Ignacio,
or of a greater personage still!&nbsp; I know what you are going
to say,&rdquo; he cried, interrupting me, as I was about to
speak, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t make his image in order to pay it
divine honours, but only to look at it, and think of Shakespeare;
but this looking at a thing in order to think of a person is the
very basis of idolatry.&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s works are not
sufficient for you; no more are the Bible or the legend of Saint
Anthony or Saint Ignacio for us, that is for those of us who
believe in them; I tell you Zingaro, that no religion can exist
long which rejects a good bodily image.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that
Shakespeare&rsquo;s works would not exist without his
image?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;that
Shakespeare&rsquo;s image is looked at more than his works, and
will be looked at, and perhaps adored, when they are
forgotten.&nbsp; I am surprised that they have not been forgotten
long ago; I am no admirer of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t imagine,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how
you will put aside the authority of Moses.&nbsp; If Moses strove
against image-worship, should not his doing so be conclusive as
to the impropriety of the practice; what higher authority can you
have than that of Moses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The practice of the great majority of the human
race,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;and the recurrence to
image-worship where image-worship has been abolished.&nbsp; Do
you know that Moses is considered by the Church as no better than
a heretic, and though, for particular reasons, it has been
obliged to adopt his writings, the adoption was merely a sham
one, as it never paid the slightest attention to them?&nbsp; No,
no, the Church was never led by Moses, nor by one mightier than
he, whose doctrine it has equally <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>nullified&mdash;I allude to Krishna
in his second avatar; the Church, it is true, governs in his
name, but not unfrequently gives him the lie, if he happens to
have said anything which it dislikes.&nbsp; Did you never hear
the reply which Padre Paolo Segani made to the French Protestant
Jean Anthoine Gu&eacute;rin, who had asked him whether it was
easier for Christ to have been mistaken in His Gospel, than for
the Pope to be mistaken in his decrees?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard their names before,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The answer was pat,&rdquo; said the man in black,
&ldquo;though he who made it was confessedly the most ignorant
fellow of the very ignorant order to which he belonged, the
Augustine.&nbsp; &lsquo;Christ might err as a man,&rsquo; said
he, &lsquo;but the Pope can never err, being God.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The whole story is related in the <i>Nipotismo</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder you should ever have troubled yourself with
Christ at all,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was to be done?&rdquo; said the man in black;
&ldquo;the power of that name suddenly came over Europe, like the
power of a mighty wind; it was said to have come from Judea, and
from Judea it probably came when it first began to agitate minds
in these parts; but it seems to have been known in the remote
East, more or less, for thousands of years previously.&nbsp; It
filled people&rsquo;s minds with madness; it was followed by
books which were never much regarded, as they contained little of
insanity; but the name! what fury that breathed into people! the
books were about peace and gentleness, but the name was the most
horrible of war-cries&mdash;those who wished to uphold old names
at first strove to oppose it, but their efforts were feeble, and
they had no good war-cry; what was Mars as a war-cry compared
with the name of . . . ?&nbsp; It was said that they persecuted
terribly, but who said so?&nbsp; The Christians.&nbsp; The
Christians could have given them a lesson in the art of
persecution, and eventually did so.&nbsp; None but Christians
have ever been good persecutors; well, the old religion
succumbed, Christianity prevailed, for the ferocious is sure to
prevail over the gentle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you stated a little
time ago that the Popish religion and the ancient Roman are the
same?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In every point but that name, that Krishna and the fury
and love of persecution which it inspired,&rdquo; said the man in
black.&nbsp; &ldquo;A hot blast came from the East, sounding
Krishna; it absolutely maddened people&rsquo;s minds, and the
people would call themselves his children; we will not belong to
Jupiter any longer, we will belong to Krishna, and they did
belong to Krishna; that is in name, but in nothing else; for who
ever cared for Krishna in the <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Christian world, or who ever regarded
the words attributed to him, or put them in practice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we Protestants regard his words, and endeavour to
practise what they enjoin as much as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you reject his image,&rdquo; said the man in black;
&ldquo;better reject his words than his image: no religion can
exist long which rejects a good bodily image.&nbsp; Why, the very
negro barbarians of High Barbary could give you a lesson on that
point; they have their fetish images, to which they look for help
in their afflictions; they have likewise a high priest, whom they
call&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mumbo Jumbo,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I know all about him
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How came you to know anything about him?&rdquo; said
the man in black, with a look of some surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of us poor Protestant tinkers,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;though we live in dingles, are also acquainted with a
thing or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really believe you are,&rdquo; said the man in black,
staring at me; &ldquo;but, in connection with this Mumbo Jumbo, I
could relate to you a comical story about a fellow, an English
servant, I once met at Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be quite unnecessary,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I
would much sooner hear you talk about Krishna, his words and
image.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spoken like a true heretic,&rdquo; said the man in
black; &ldquo;one of the faithful would have placed his image
before his words; for what are all the words in the world
compared with a good bodily image!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you occasionally quote his words?&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He! he!&rdquo; said the man in black;
&ldquo;occasionally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For example,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;upon this rock I
will found my Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He! he!&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;you must
really become one of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you must have had some difficulty in getting the
rock to Rome?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; said the man in black;
&ldquo;faith can remove mountains, to say nothing of
rocks&mdash;ho! ho!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I cannot imagine,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what
advantage you could derive from perverting those words of
Scripture in which the Saviour talks about eating His
body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know, indeed, why we troubled our heads about
the matter at all,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;but when
you talk about perverting the meaning of the text, you speak
ignorantly, Mr. Tinker; when He whom you call the Saviour gave
His followers the sop, and bade them eat it, telling them it was
His <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>body,
He delicately alluded to what it was incumbent upon them to do
after His death, namely, to eat His body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not mean to say that He intended they should
actually eat His body?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you suppose ignorantly,&rdquo; said the man in
black; &ldquo;eating the bodies of the dead was a heathenish
custom, practised by the heirs and legatees of people who left
property; and this custom is alluded to in the text.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what has the New Testament to do with heathen
customs,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;except to destroy them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than you suppose,&rdquo; said the man in
black.&nbsp; &ldquo;We priests of Rome, who have long lived at
Rome, know much better what the New Testament is made of than the
heretics and their theologians, not forgetting their Tinkers;
though I confess some of the latter have occasionally surprised
us&mdash;for example, Bunyan.&nbsp; The New Testament is crowded
with allusions to heathen customs, and with words connected with
pagan sorcery.&nbsp; Now, with respect to words, I would fain
have you, who pretend to be a philologist, tell me the meaning of
Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We of Rome,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;know
two or three things of which the heretics are quite ignorant; for
example, there are those amongst us&mdash;those, too, who do not
pretend to be philologists&mdash;who know what Amen is, and
moreover, how we got it.&nbsp; We got it from our ancestors, the
priests of ancient Rome; and they got the word from their
ancestors of the East, the priests of Buddh and
Brahma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is the meaning of the word?&rdquo; I
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;is a
modification of the old Hindoo formula, <i>Omani batsikhom</i>,
by the almost ceaseless repetition of which the Indians hope to
be received finally to the rest or state of forgetfulness of
Buddh or Brahma; a foolish practice you will say, but are you
heretics much wiser, who are continually sticking Amen to the end
of your prayers, little knowing when you do so, that you are
consigning yourselves to the repose of Buddh!&nbsp; Oh, what
hearty laughs our missionaries have had when comparing the
eternally-sounding Eastern gibberish of <i>Omani batsikhom</i>,
<i>Omani batsikhom</i>, and the Ave Maria and Amen Jesus of our
own idiotical devotees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to say about the Ave Marias and Amens of
your superstitious devotees,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I dare say
that they use them nonsensically enough, but in putting Amen to
the end of a prayer, we merely intend to express, &lsquo;So let
it be&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>&ldquo;It means nothing of the kind,&rdquo; said the man
in black; &ldquo;and the Hindoos might just as well put your
national oath at the end of their prayers, as perhaps they will
after a great many thousand years, when English is forgotten, and
only a few words of it remembered by dim tradition without being
understood.&nbsp; How strange if, after the lapse of four
thousand years, the Hindoos should damn themselves to the
blindness so dear to their present masters, even as their masters
at present consign themselves to the forgetfulness so dear to the
Hindoos; but my glass has been empty for a considerable time;
perhaps, <i>Bellissima Biondina</i>,&rdquo; said he, addressing
Belle, &ldquo;you will deign to replenish it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do no such thing,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;you
have drunk quite enough, and talked more than enough, and to tell
you the truth, I wish you would leave us alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame on you, Belle,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;consider the
obligations of hospitality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sick of that word,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;you
are so frequently misusing it; were this place not Mumpers&rsquo;
Dingle, and consequently as free to the fellow as ourselves, I
would lead him out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray be quiet, Belle,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
had better help yourself,&rdquo; said I, addressing myself to the
man in black, &ldquo;the lady is angry with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry for it,&rdquo; said the man in black;
&ldquo;if she is angry with me, I am not so with her, and shall
be always proud to wait upon her; in the meantime, I will wait
upon myself.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> man in black having helped
himself to some more of his favourite beverage, and tasted it, I
thus addressed him: &ldquo;The evening is getting rather
advanced, and I can see that this lady,&rdquo; pointing to Belle,
&ldquo;is anxious for her tea, which she prefers to take cosily
and comfortably with me in the dingle: the place, it is true, is
as free to you as to ourselves, nevertheless as we are located
here by necessity, whilst you merely come as a visitor, I must
take the liberty of telling you that we shall be glad to be
alone, as soon as you have said what you have to say, and have
finished the glass of refreshment at present in your hand.&nbsp;
I think you said some time ago that one of your motives for
coming hither was to induce me to enlist under the banner of
Rome.&nbsp; I wish to know whether that was really the
case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decidedly so,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;I
come here principally in the hope of enlisting you in our
regiment, in which I have no doubt you could do us excellent
service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you enlist my companion as well?&rdquo; I
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should be only too proud to have her among us,
whether she comes with you or alone,&rdquo; said the man in
black, with a polite bow to Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we give you an answer,&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;I would fain know more about you; perhaps you will declare
your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I will never do,&rdquo; said the man in black;
&ldquo;no one in England knows it but myself, and I will not
declare it, even in a dingle; as for the rest, <i>Sono un Prete
Cattolico Appostolico</i>&mdash;that is all that many a one of us
can say for himself, and it assuredly means a great
deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will now proceed to business,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You must be aware that we English are generally considered
a self-interested people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And with considerable justice,&rdquo; said the man in
black, drinking.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, you are a person of acute
perception, and I will presently make it evident to you that it
would be to your interest to join with us.&nbsp; You are at
present, evidently, in very needy circumstances, and are lost,
not only to yourself, but to the <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>world; but should you enlist with us,
I could find you an occupation not only agreeable, but one in
which your talents would have free scope.&nbsp; I would introduce
you in the various grand houses here in England, to which I have
myself admission, as a surprising young gentleman of infinite
learning, who by dint of study has discovered that the Roman is
the only true faith.&nbsp; I tell you confidently that our popish
females would make a saint, nay, a God of you; they are fools
enough for anything.&nbsp; There is one person in particular with
whom I should wish to make you acquainted, in the hope that you
would be able to help me to perform good service to the holy
see.&nbsp; He is a gouty old fellow, of some learning, residing
in an old hall, near the great western seaport, and is one of the
very few amongst the English Catholics possessing a grain of
sense.&nbsp; I think you could help us to govern him, for he is
not unfrequently disposed to be restive, asks us strange
questions&mdash;occasionally threatens us with his crutch; and
behaves so that we are often afraid that we shall lose him, or,
rather, his property, which he has bequeathed to us, and which is
enormous.&nbsp; I am sure that you could help us to deal with
him; sometimes with your humour, sometimes with your learning,
and perhaps occasionally with your fists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in what manner would you provide for my
companion?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would place her at once,&rdquo; said the man in
black, &ldquo;in the house of two highly respectable Catholic
ladies in this neighbourhood, where she would be treated with
every care and consideration till her conversion should be
accomplished in a regular manner; we would then remove her to a
female monastic establishment, where, after undergoing a
year&rsquo;s probation, during which time she would be instructed
in every elegant accomplishment, she should take the veil.&nbsp;
Her advancement would speedily follow, for, with such a face and
figure, she would make a capital lady abbess, especially in
Italy, to which country she would probably be sent; ladies of her
hair and complexion&mdash;to say nothing of her
height&mdash;being a curiosity in the south.&nbsp; With a little
care and management she could soon obtain a vast reputation for
sanctity; and who knows but after her death she might become a
glorified saint&mdash;he! he!&nbsp; Sister Maria Theresa, for
that is the name I propose you should bear.&nbsp; Holy Mother
Maria Theresa&mdash;glorified and celestial saint, I have the
honour of drinking to your health,&rdquo; and the man in black
drank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Belle,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what have you to say
to the gentleman&rsquo;s proposal?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>&ldquo;That if he goes on in this way I will break his
glass against his mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have heard the lady&rsquo;s answer,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;and shall
not press the matter.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t help, however,
repeating that she would make a capital lady abbess; she would
keep the nuns in order, I warrant her; no easy matter!&nbsp;
Break the glass against my mouth&mdash;he! he!&nbsp; How she
would send the holy utensils flying at the nuns&rsquo; heads
occasionally, and just the person to wring the nose of Satan,
should he venture to appear one night in her cell in the shape of
a handsome black man.&nbsp; No offence, madam, no offence, pray
retain your seat,&rdquo; said he, observing that Belle had
started up; &ldquo;I mean no offence.&nbsp; Well, if you will not
consent to be an abbess, perhaps you will consent to follow this
young Zingaro, and to co-operate with him and us.&nbsp; I am a
priest, madam, and can join you both in an instant, <i>connubio
stabili</i>, as I suppose the knot has not been tied
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your mumping gibberish,&rdquo; said Belle,
&ldquo;and leave the dingle this moment, for though &rsquo;t is
free to every one, you have no right to insult me in
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray be pacified,&rdquo; said I to Belle, getting up,
and placing myself between her and the man in black; &ldquo;he
will presently leave, take my word for it&mdash;there, sit down
again,&rdquo; said I, as I led her to her seat; then, resuming my
own, I said to the man in black: &ldquo;I advise you to leave the
dingle as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should wish to have your answer to my proposal
first,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, here you shall have it: I will not
entertain your proposal; I detest your schemes: they are both
wicked and foolish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wicked,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;have they
not&mdash;he! he!&mdash;the furtherance of religion in
view?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A religion,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;in which you yourself
do not believe, and which you contemn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether I believe in it or not,&rdquo; said the man in
black, &ldquo;it is adapted for the generality of the human race;
so I will forward it, and advise you to do the same.&nbsp; It was
nearly extirpated in these regions, but it is springing up again
owing to circumstances.&nbsp; Radicalism is a good friend to us;
all the Liberals laud up our system out of hatred to the
Established Church, though our system is ten times less liberal
than the Church of England.&nbsp; Some of them have really come
over to us.&nbsp; I myself confess a baronet who presided over
the first Radical meeting ever held in <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>England&mdash;he was an atheist when
he came over to us, in the hope of mortifying his own
Church&mdash;but he is now&mdash;ho! ho!&mdash;a real Catholic
devotee&mdash;quite afraid of my threats; I make him frequently
scourge himself before me.&nbsp; Well, Radicalism does us good
service, especially amongst the lower classes, for Radicalism
chiefly flourishes amongst them; for though a baronet or two may
be found amongst the Radicals, and perhaps as many
lords&mdash;fellows who have been discarded by their own order
for clownishness, or something they have done&mdash;it
incontestably flourishes best among the lower orders.&nbsp; Then
the love of what is foreign is a great friend to us; this love is
chiefly confined to the middle and upper classes.&nbsp; Some
admire the French, and imitate them; others must needs be
Spaniards, dress themselves up in a <i>zamarra</i>, stick a cigar
in their mouth, and say, <i>c&mdash;jo</i>.&nbsp; Others would
pass for Germans; he! he! the idea of any one wishing to pass for
a German! but what has done us more service than anything else in
these regions&mdash;I mean amidst the middle classes&mdash;has
been the novel, the Scotch novel.&nbsp; The good folks, since
they have read the novels, have become Jacobites; and, because
all the Jacobs were Papists, the good folks must become Papists
also, or, at least, papistically inclined.&nbsp; The very Scotch
Presbyterians, since they have read the novels, are become all
but Papists; I speak advisedly, having lately been amongst
them.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a trumpery bit of a half-papist sect,
called the Scotch Episcopalian Church, which lay dormant and
nearly forgotten for upwards of a hundred years, which has of
late got wonderfully into fashion in Scotland, because, forsooth,
some of the long-haired gentry of the novels were said to belong
to it, such as Montrose and Dundee; and to this the Presbyterians
are going over in throngs, traducing and vilifying their own
forefathers, or denying them altogether, and calling themselves
descendants of&mdash;ho! ho! ho!&mdash;Scottish
Cavaliers!!!&nbsp; I heard them myself repeating snatches of
Jacobite ditties about &lsquo;Bonnie Dundee,&rsquo;
and:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Come, fill up my cup, and fill up my
can,<br />
And saddle my horse, and call up my man.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s stuff for you!&nbsp; Not that I object to the
first part of the ditty.&nbsp; It is natural enough that a
Scotchman should cry, &lsquo;Come, fill up my cup!&rsquo; more
especially if he&rsquo;s drinking at another person&rsquo;s
expense&mdash;all Scotchmen being fond of liquor at free cost:
but &lsquo;Saddle his horse!!!&rsquo;&mdash;for what purpose, I
would ask?&nbsp; Where is the use of saddling a horse, unless you
can ride him? and where was there ever a Scotchman who could
ride?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>&ldquo;Of course you have not a drop of Scotch blood in
your veins,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;otherwise you would never have
uttered that last sentence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure of that,&rdquo; said the man in
black; &ldquo;you know little of Popery if you imagine that it
cannot extinguish love of country, even in a Scotchman.&nbsp; A
thorough-going Papist&mdash;and who more thorough-going than
myself?&mdash;cares nothing for his country; and why should he?
he belongs to a system, and not to a country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;connected with you, I
cannot understand; you call yourself a thorough-going Papist, yet
are continually saying the most pungent things against Popery,
and turning to unbounded ridicule those who show any inclination
to embrace it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rome is a very sensible old body,&rdquo; said the man
in black, &ldquo;and little cares what her children say, provided
they do her bidding.&nbsp; She knows several things, and amongst
others, that no servants work so hard and faithfully as those who
curse their masters at every stroke they do.&nbsp; She was not
fool enough to be angry with the Miquelets of Alba, who renounced
her, and called her <i>puta</i> all the time they were cutting
the throats of the Netherlanders.&nbsp; Now, if she allowed her
faithful soldiers the latitude of renouncing her, and calling her
<i>puta</i> in the marketplace, think not she is so unreasonable
as to object to her faithful priests occasionally calling her
<i>puta</i> in the dingle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;suppose some one were to
tell the world some of the disorderly things which her priests
say in the dingle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would have the fate of Cassandra,&rdquo; said the
man in black; &ldquo;no one would believe him&mdash;yes, the
priests would: but they would make no sign of belief.&nbsp; They
believe in the <i>Alcoran des Cordeliers</i>&mdash;that is, those
who have read it; but they make no sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty system,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;which
extinguishes love of country and of everything noble, and brings
the minds of its ministers to a parity with those of devils, who
delight in nothing but mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The system,&rdquo; said the man in black, &ldquo;is a
grand one, with unbounded vitality.&nbsp; Compare it with your
Protestantism, and you will see the difference.&nbsp; Popery is
ever at work, whilst Protestantism is supine.&nbsp; A pretty
Church, indeed, the Protestant!&nbsp; Why, it can&rsquo;t even
work a miracle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can your Church work miracles?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>&ldquo;That was the very question,&rdquo; said the man
in black, &ldquo;which the ancient British clergy asked of Austin
Monk, after they had been fools enough to acknowledge their own
inability.&nbsp; &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t pretend to work miracles;
do you?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh! dear me, yes,&rsquo; said Austin;
&lsquo;we find no difficulty in the matter.&nbsp; We can raise
the dead, we can make the blind see; and to convince you, I will
give sight to the blind.&nbsp; Here is this blind Saxon, whom you
cannot cure, but on whose eyes I will manifest my power, in order
to show the difference between the true and the false
Church;&rsquo; and forthwith, with the assistance of a
handkerchief and a little hot water, he opened the eyes of the
barbarian.&nbsp; So we manage matters!&nbsp; A pretty Church,
that old British Church, which could not work
miracles&mdash;quite as helpless as the modern one.&nbsp; The
fools! was birdlime so scarce a thing amongst them?&mdash;and
were the properties of warm water so unknown to them, that they
could not close a pair of eyes and open them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that the
British clergy at that interview with Austin did not bring
forward a blind Welshman, and ask the monk to operate upon
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clearly,&rdquo; said the man in black;
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s what they ought to have done; but they were
fools without a single resource.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here he took a sip
at his glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they did not believe in the miracle?&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did their not believing avail them?&rdquo;
said the man in black, &ldquo;Austin remained master of the
field, and they went away holding their heads down, and muttering
to themselves.&nbsp; What a fine subject for a painting would be
Austin&rsquo;s opening the eyes of the Saxon barbarian, and the
discomfiture of the British clergy!&nbsp; I wonder it has not
been painted!&mdash;he! he!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose your Church still performs miracles
occasionally!&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does,&rdquo; said the man in black.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Rev. &mdash; has lately been performing miracles in Ireland,
destroying devils that had got possession of people; he has been
eminently successful.&nbsp; In two instances he not only
destroyed the devils, but the lives of the people
possessed&mdash;he! he!&nbsp; Oh! there is so much energy in our
system; we are always at work, whilst Protestantism is
supine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not imagine,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that all
Protestants are supine; some of them appear to be filled with
unbounded zeal.&nbsp; They deal, it is true, not in lying
miracles, but they propagate God&rsquo;s Word.&nbsp; I remember
only a few months ago, having occasion for a Bible, going to an
establishment, the object of <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>which was to send Bibles all over the
world.&nbsp; The supporters of that establishment could have no
self-interested views; for I was supplied by them with a
noble-sized Bible at a price so small as to preclude the idea
that it could bring any profit to the vendors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The countenance of the man in black slightly fell.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know the people to whom you allude,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;indeed, unknown to them, I have frequently been to see
them, and observed their ways.&nbsp; I tell you frankly that
there is not a set of people in this kingdom who have caused our
Church so much trouble and uneasiness.&nbsp; I should rather say
that they alone cause us any; for as for the rest, what with
their drowsiness, their plethora, their folly and their vanity,
they are doing us anything but mischief.&nbsp; These fellows are
a pestilent set of heretics, whom we would gladly see burnt; they
are, with the most untiring perseverance, and in spite of divers
minatory declarations of the holy father, scattering their books
abroad through all Europe, and have caused many people in
Catholic countries to think that hitherto their priesthood have
endeavoured, as much as possible, to keep them blinded.&nbsp;
There is one fellow amongst them for whom we entertain a
particular aversion; a big, burly parson, with the face of a
lion, the voice of a buffalo, and a fist like a
sledge-hammer.&nbsp; The last time I was there, I observed that
his eye was upon me, and I did not like the glance he gave me at
all; I observed him clench his fist, and I took my departure as
fast as I conveniently could.&nbsp; Whether he suspected who I
was, I know not; but I did not like his look at all, and do not
intend to go again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you confess that you
have redoubtable enemies to your plans in these regions, and that
even amongst the ecclesiastics there are some widely different
from those of the plethoric and Platitude schools?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is but too true,&rdquo; said the man in black;
&ldquo;and if the rest of your Church were like them we should
quickly bid adieu to all hope of converting these regions, but we
are thankful to be able to say that such folks are not numerous;
there are, moreover, causes at work quite sufficient to undermine
even their zeal.&nbsp; Their sons return at the vacations, from
Oxford and Cambridge, puppies, full of the nonsense which they
have imbibed from Platitude professors; and this nonsense they
retail at home, where it fails not to make some impression,
whilst the daughters scream&mdash;I beg their
pardons&mdash;warble about Scotland&rsquo;s Montrose, and Bonny
Dundee, and all the Jacobs; so we have no doubt <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>that their
papas&rsquo; zeal about the propagation of such a vulgar book as
the Bible will in a very little time be terribly
diminished.&nbsp; Old Rome will win, so you had better join
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the man in black drained the last drop in his glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;will I become the slave of
Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will allow you latitude,&rdquo; said the man in
black; &ldquo;do but serve her, and she will allow you to call
her <i>puta</i> at a decent time and place, her popes
occasionally call her <i>puta</i>.&nbsp; A pope has been known to
start from his bed at midnight and rush out into the corridor,
and call out <i>puta</i> three times in a voice which pierced the
Vatican; that pope was &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alexander the Sixth, I dare say,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;the greatest monster that ever existed, though the
worthiest head which the popish system ever had&mdash;so his
conscience was not always still.&nbsp; I thought it had been
seared with a brand of iron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not allude to him, but to a much more modern
pope,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;it is true he brought
the word, which is Spanish, from Spain, his native country, to
Rome.&nbsp; He was very fond of calling the Church by that name,
and other popes have taken it up.&nbsp; She will allow you to
call her by it, if you belong to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall call her so,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;without
belonging to her, or asking her permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will allow you to treat her as such, if you belong
to her,&rdquo; said the man in black; &ldquo;there is a chapel in
Rome, where there is a wondrously fair statue&mdash;the son of a
cardinal&mdash;I mean his nephew&mdash;once&mdash;&nbsp; Well,
she did not cut off his head, but slightly boxed his cheek and
bade him go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have read all about that in <i>Keysler&rsquo;s
Travels</i>,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;do you tell her that I would
not touch her with a pair of tongs, unless to seize her
nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is fond of lucre,&rdquo; said the man in black;
&ldquo;but does not grudge a faithful priest a little private
perquisite,&rdquo; and he took out a very handsome gold
repeater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you not afraid,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to flash that
watch before the eyes of a poor tinker in a dingle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not before the eyes of one like you,&rdquo; said the
man in black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is getting late,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I care not
for perquisites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you will not join us?&rdquo; said the man in
black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have had my answer,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I belong to Rome,&rdquo; said the man in black,
&ldquo;why should not you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may be a poor tinker,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I may
never have <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>undergone what you have.&nbsp; You remember, perhaps,
the fable of the fox who had lost his tail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man in black winced, but almost immediately recovering
himself, he said: &ldquo;Well, we can do without you, we are sure
of winning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not the part of wise people,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;to make sure of the battle before it is fought:
there&rsquo;s the landlord of the public-house, who made sure
that his cocks would win, yet the cocks lost the main, and the
landlord is little better than a bankrupt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People very different from the landlord,&rdquo; said
the man in black, &ldquo;both in intellect and station, think we
shall surely win; there are clever machinators among us who have
no doubt of our success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I will set the landlord
aside, and will adduce one who was in every point a very
different person from the landlord, both in understanding and
station; he was very fond of laying schemes, and, indeed, many of
them turned out successful.&nbsp; His last and darling one,
however, miscarried, notwithstanding that by his calculations he
had persuaded himself that there was no possibility of its
failing&mdash;the person that I allude to was old
Fraser&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; said the man in black, giving a start, and
letting his glass fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Fraser of Lovat,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;the prince
of all conspirators and machinators; he made sure of placing the
Pretender on the throne of these realms.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can bring
into the field so many men,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;my son-in-law,
Cluny, so many, and likewise my cousin, and my good
friend;&rsquo; then speaking of those on whom the Government
reckoned for support, he would say: &lsquo;So and so are
lukewarm, this person is ruled by his wife, who is with us, the
clergy are anything but hostile to us, and as for the soldiers
and sailors, half are disaffected to King George, and the rest
cowards&rsquo;.&nbsp; Yet when things came to a trial, this
person whom he had calculated upon to join the Pretender did not
stir from his home, another joined the hostile ranks, the
presumed cowards turned out heroes, and those whom he thought
heroes ran away like lusty fellows at Culloden; in a word, he
found himself utterly mistaken, and in nothing more than in
himself; he thought he was a hero, and proved himself nothing
more than an old fox; he got up a hollow tree, didn&rsquo;t he,
just like a fox?</p>
<blockquote><p><i>L&rsquo;opere sue non furon leonine, ma di
volpe</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24"
class="citation">[24]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>The man
in black sat silent for a considerable time, and at length
answered in rather a faltering voice: &ldquo;I was not prepared
for this; you have frequently surprised me by your knowledge of
things which I should never have expected any person of your
appearance to be acquainted with, but that you should be aware of
my name is a circumstance utterly incomprehensible to me.&nbsp; I
had imagined that no person in England was acquainted with it;
indeed, I don&rsquo;t see how any person should be, I have
revealed it to no one, not being particularly proud of it.&nbsp;
Yes, I acknowledge that my name is Fraser, and that I am of the
blood of that family or clan, of which the rector of our college
once said, that he was firmly of opinion that every individual
member was either rogue or fool.&nbsp; I was born at Madrid, of
pure, <i>oim&egrave;</i>, Fraser blood.&nbsp; My parents, at an
early age, took me to &mdash;, where they shortly died, not,
however, before they had placed me in the service of a cardinal,
with whom I continued some years, and who, when he had no further
occasion for me, sent me to the college, in the left-hand
cloister of which, as you enter, rest the bones of Sir John
D&mdash;; there, in studying logic and humane letters, I lost
whatever of humanity I had retained when discarded by the
cardinal.&nbsp; Let me not, however, forget two points, I am a
Fraser, it is true, but not a Flannagan; I may bear the vilest
name of Britain, but not of Ireland; I was bred up at the English
house, and there is at &mdash; a house for the education of
bog-trotters; I was not bred up at that; beneath the lowest gulf,
there is one yet lower; whatever my blood may be, it is at least
not Irish; whatever my education may have been, I was not bred at
the Irish seminary&mdash;on those accounts I am
thankful&mdash;yes, <i>per Dio</i>!&nbsp; I am thankful.&nbsp;
After some years at college&mdash;but why should I tell you my
history? you know it already perfectly well, probably much better
than myself.&nbsp; I am now a missionary priest, labouring in
heretic England, like Parsons and Garnet of old, save and except
that, unlike them, I run no danger, for the times are
changed.&nbsp; As I told you before, I shall cleave to
Rome&mdash;I must; <i>no hay remedio</i>, as they say at Madrid,
and I will do my best to further her holy plans&mdash;he!
he!&mdash;but I confess I begin to doubt of their being
successful here&mdash;you put me out; old Fraser of Lovat!&nbsp;
I have heard my father talk of him; he had a gold-headed cane,
with which he once knocked my grandfather down&mdash;he was an
astute one, but, as you say, mistaken, particularly in
himself.&nbsp; I have read his life by Arbuthnot, it is in the
library of our college.&nbsp; Farewell!&nbsp; I shall come no
more to this dingle&mdash;to come would be of no utility; I shall
go and labour elsewhere, <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>though &mdash; how you came to know
my name, is a fact quite inexplicable&mdash;farewell! to you
both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then arose, and without further salutation departed from
the dingle, in which I never saw him again.&nbsp; &ldquo;How, in
the name of wonder, came you to know that man&rsquo;s
name?&rdquo; said Belle, after he had been gone some time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, Belle?&nbsp; I knew nothing of the fellow&rsquo;s
name, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you mentioned his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I did, it was merely casually, by way of
illustration.&nbsp; I was saying how frequently cunning people
were mistaken in their calculations, and I adduced the case of
old Fraser of Lovat, as one in point; I brought forward his name,
because I was well acquainted with his history, from having
compiled and inserted it in a wonderful work, which I edited some
months ago, entitled <i>Newgate Lives and Trials</i>, but without
the slightest idea that it was the name of him who was sitting
with us; he, however, thought that I was aware of his name.&nbsp;
Belle! Belle! for a long time I doubted the truth of Scripture,
owing to certain conceited discourses which I had heard from
certain conceited individuals, but now I begin to believe firmly;
what wonderful texts there are in Scripture, Belle!&nbsp;
&lsquo;The wicked trembleth
where&mdash;where&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;They were afraid where no fear was; thou hast
put them to confusion, because God hath despised
them,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;I have frequently read it
before the clergyman in the great house of Long Melford.&nbsp;
But if you did not know the man&rsquo;s name, why let him go away
supposing that you did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if he was fool enough to make such a mistake, I was
not going to undeceive him&mdash;no, no!&nbsp; Let the enemies of
old England make the most of all their blunders and mistakes,
they will have no help from me; but enough of the fellow, Belle;
let us now have tea, and after that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Armenian,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;but I want to
ask a question: pray are all people of that man&rsquo;s name
either rogues or fools?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible for me to say, Belle, this person
being the only one of the name I have ever personally
known.&nbsp; I suppose there are good and bad, clever and
foolish, amongst them, as amongst all large bodies of people;
however, after the tribe had been governed for upwards of thirty
years by such a person as old Fraser, it were no wonder if the
greater part had become either rogues or fools: he was a ruthless
tyrant, Belle, over his own people, and by his cruelty and
rapaciousness must either have stunned them into an apathy
approaching to idiotcy, or <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>made them artful knaves in their own
defence.&nbsp; The qualities of parents are generally transmitted
to their descendants&mdash;the progeny of trained pointers are
almost sure to point, even without being taught: if, therefore,
all Frasers are either rogues or fools, as this person seems to
insinuate, it is little to be wondered at, their parents or
grandparents having been in the training-school of old
Fraser!&nbsp; But enough of the old tyrant and his slaves.&nbsp;
Belle, prepare tea this moment, or dread my anger.&nbsp; I have
not a gold-headed cane like old Fraser of Lovat, but I have, what
some people would dread much more, an Armenian
rune-stick.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the following morning, as I was
about to leave my tent, I heard the voice of Belle at the door,
exclaiming: &ldquo;Sleepest thou, or wakest thou?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was never more awake in my life,&rdquo; said I, going
out.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He of
the horse-shoe,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;Jasper, of whom I have
heard you talk, is above there on the field with all his people;
I went about a quarter of an hour ago to fill the kettle at the
spring, and saw them arriving.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
well,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;have you any objection to asking him
and his wife to breakfast?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You can do as you
please,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I have cups enough, and have no
objection to their company.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We are the first
occupiers of the ground,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and, being so,
should consider ourselves in the light of hosts, and do our best
to practise the duties of hospitality.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How
fond you are of using that word,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;if you
wish to invite the man and his wife, do so, without more ado;
remember, however, that I have not cups enough, nor indeed tea
enough, for the whole company.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon hurrying up
the ascent, I presently found myself outside the dingle.&nbsp; It
was as usual a brilliant morning, the dewy blades of the
rye-grass which covered the plain sparkled brightly in the beams
of the sun, which had probably been about two hours above the
horizon.&nbsp; A rather numerous body of my ancient friends and
allies occupied the ground in the vicinity of the mouth of the
dingle.&nbsp; About five yards on the right I perceived Mr.
Petulengro busily employed in erecting his tent; he held in his
hand an iron bar, sharp at the bottom, with a kind of arm
projecting from the top for the purpose of supporting a kettle or
cauldron over the fire, and which is called in the Romanian
language &ldquo;Kekauviskoe saster&rdquo;.&nbsp; With the sharp
end of this Mr. Petulengro was making holes in the earth, at
about twenty inches distant from each other, into which he
inserted certain long rods with a considerable bend towards the
top, which constituted no less than the timbers of the tent, and
the supporters of the canvas.&nbsp; Mrs. Petulengro, and a female
with a crutch in her hand, whom I recognised as Mrs. Chikno, sat
near him on the ground, whilst two or three children, <a

ten years old, who composed the young family of Mr. and Mrs.
Petulengro, were playing about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are, brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, as he
drove the sharp end of the bar into the ground; &ldquo;here we
are and plenty of us&mdash;Bute dosta Romany chals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to see you all,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and
particularly you, madam,&rdquo; said I, making a bow to Mrs.
Petulengro; &ldquo;and you also, madam,&rdquo; taking off my hat
to Mrs. Chikno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-day to you, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro;
&ldquo;you look, as usual, charmingly, and speak so, too; you
have not forgot your manners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not all gold that glitters,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Chikno.&nbsp; &ldquo;However, good-morrow to you, young
rye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not see Tawno,&rdquo; said I, looking around;
&ldquo;where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, indeed!&rdquo; said Mrs. Chikno; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know; he who countenances him in the roving line can
best answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will be here anon,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro;
&ldquo;he has merely ridden down a by-road to show a farmer a
two-year-old colt; she heard me give him directions, but she
can&rsquo;t be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, indeed,&rdquo; said Mrs. Chikno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not, sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I place no confidence in your words, brother;
as I said before, you countenances him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I know nothing of your
private concerns; I am come on an errand.&nbsp; Isopel Berners,
down in the dell there, requests the pleasure of Mr. and Mrs.
Petulengro&rsquo;s company at breakfast.&nbsp; She will be happy
also to see you, madam,&rdquo; said I, addressing Mrs.
Chikno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that young female your wife, young man?&rdquo; said
Mrs. Chikno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, young man; your wife, your lawful certificated
wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;she is not my
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will not visit with her,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Chikno; &ldquo;I countenance nothing in the roving
line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by the roving line?&rdquo; I
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I mean by the roving line?&nbsp; Why, by it I
mean such conduct as is not tatcheno.&nbsp; When ryes and rawnies
live together in dingles, without being certificated, I call such
behaviour being tolerably deep in the roving line, everything
savouring of which I am determined not to sanctify.&nbsp; I have
suffered too much by my own certificated husband&rsquo;s
outbreaks in <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>that line to afford anything of the kind the slightest
shadow of countenance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is hard that people may not live in dingles together
without being suspected of doing wrong,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, interposing;
&ldquo;and, to tell you the truth, I am altogether surprised at
the illiberality of my sister&rsquo;s remarks.&nbsp; I have often
heard say, that is in good company&mdash;and I have kept good
company in my time&mdash;that suspicion is king&rsquo;s evidence
of a narrow and uncultivated mind; on which account I am
suspicious of nobody, not even of my own husband, whom some
people would think I have a right to be suspicious of, seeing
that on his account I once refused a lord; but ask him whether I
am suspicious of him, and whether I seeks to keep him close tied
to my apron-string; he will tell you nothing of the kind; but
that, on the contrary, I always allows him an agreeable latitude,
permitting him to go where he pleases, and to converse with any
one to whose manner of speaking he may take a fancy.&nbsp; But I
have had the advantage of keeping good company, and
therefore&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mek lis,&rdquo; said Mrs. Chikno, &ldquo;pray drop all
that, sister; I believe I have kept as good company as yourself;
and with respect to that offer with which you frequently fatigue
those who keeps company with you, I believe, after all, it was
something in the roving and uncertificated line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In whatever line it was,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro,
&ldquo;the offer was a good one.&nbsp; The young duke&mdash;for
he was not only a lord, but a duke too&mdash;offered to keep me a
fine carriage, and to make me his second wife; for it is true
that he had another who was old and stout, though mighty rich,
and highly good-natured; so much so, indeed, that the young lord
assured me that she would have no manner of objection to the
arrangement; more especially if I would consent to live in the
same house with her, being fond of young and cheerful
society.&nbsp; So you see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Chikno, &ldquo;I see what I
before thought, that it was altogether in the uncertificated
line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mek lis,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro; &ldquo;I use your
own word, madam, which is Romany: for my own part, I am not fond
of using Romany words, unless I can hope to pass them off for
French, which I cannot in the present company.&nbsp; I heartily
wish that there was no such language, and do my best to keep it
away from my children, lest the frequent use of it should
altogether confirm them in low and vulgar habits.&nbsp; I have
four children, madam, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>&ldquo;I suppose by talking of your four children you
wish to check me for having none,&rdquo; said Mrs. Chikno
bursting into tears; &ldquo;if I have no children, sister, it is
no fault of mine, it is&mdash;but why do I call you
sister?&rdquo; said she angrily; &ldquo;you are no sister of
mine, you are a grasni, a regular mare&mdash;a pretty sister,
indeed, ashamed of your own language.&nbsp; I remember well that
by your high-flying notions you drove your own
mother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will drop it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro; &ldquo;I
do not wish to raise my voice, and to make myself
ridiculous.&nbsp; Young gentleman,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;pray
present my compliments to Miss Isopel Berners, and inform her
that I am very sorry that I cannot accept her polite
invitation.&nbsp; I am just arrived, and have some slight
domestic matters to see to&mdash;amongst others, to wash my
children&rsquo;s faces; but that in the course of the forenoon,
when I have attended to what I have to do, and have dressed
myself, I hope to do myself the honour of paying her a regular
visit; you will tell her that, with my compliments.&nbsp; With
respect to my husband, he can answer for himself, as I, not being
of a jealous disposition, never interferes with his
matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And tell Miss Berners,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro,
&ldquo;that I shall be happy to wait upon her in company with my
wife as soon as we are regularly settled: at present I have much
on my hands, having not only to pitch my own tent, but this here
jealous woman&rsquo;s, whose husband is absent on my
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon I returned to the dingle, and, without saying
anything about Mrs. Chikno&rsquo;s observations, communicated to
Isopel the messages of Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro; Isopel made no
other reply than by replacing in her coffer two additional cups
and saucers, which, in expectation of company, she had placed
upon the board.&nbsp; The kettle was by this time boiling.&nbsp;
We sat down, and, as we breakfasted, I gave Isopel Berners
another lesson in the Armenian language.</p>
<h2><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">About</span> midday Mr. and Mrs.
Petulengro came to the dingle to pay the promised visit.&nbsp;
Belle, at the time of their arrival, was in her tent, but I was
at the fire-place, engaged in hammering part of the outer-tire,
or defence, which had come off from one of the wheels of my
vehicle.&nbsp; On perceiving them I forthwith went to receive
them.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro was dressed in Roman fashion, with a
somewhat smartly cut sporting-coat, the buttons of which were
half-crowns, and a waistcoat scarlet and black, the buttons of
which were spaded half-guineas; his breeches were of a stuff
half-velveteen, half-corduroy, the cords exceedingly broad.&nbsp;
He had leggings of buff cloth, furred at the bottom, and upon his
feet were highlows.&nbsp; Under his left arm was a long black
whale-bone riding-whip, with a red lash, and an immense silver
knob.&nbsp; Upon his head was a hat with a high peak, somewhat of
the kind which the Spaniards call <i>cala&ntilde;&eacute;s</i>,
so much in favour with the bravos of Seville and Madrid.&nbsp;
Now, when I have added that Mr. Petulengro had on a very fine
white holland shirt, I think I have described his array.&nbsp;
Mrs. Petulengro&mdash;I beg pardon for not having spoken of her
first&mdash;was also arrayed very much in the Roman
fashion.&nbsp; Her hair, which was exceedingly black and
lustrous, fell in braids on either side of her head.&nbsp; In her
ears were rings, with long drops of gold.&nbsp; Round her neck
was a string of what seemed very much like very large pearls,
somewhat tarnished, however, and apparently of considerable
antiquity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here we are, brother,&rdquo; said Mr.
Petulengro; &ldquo;here we are, come to see you&mdash;wizard and
witch, witch and wizard:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a chovahanee, and a
chovahano,<br />
The nav se len is Petulengro&rsquo;&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro;
&ldquo;you make me ashamed of you with your vulgar ditties.&nbsp;
We are come a visiting now, and everything low should be left
behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;why bring
what&rsquo;s low to the dingle, which is low enough
already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, are you a catcher at words?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I thought <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>that catching at words had been confined to the pothouse
farmers and village witty bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All fools,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, &ldquo;catch at
words, and very naturally, as by so doing they hope to prevent
the possibility of rational conversation.&nbsp; Catching at words
confined to pothouse farmers, and village witty bodies!&nbsp; No,
not to Jasper Petulengro.&nbsp; Listen for an hour or two to the
discourse of a set they call newspaper editors, and if you
don&rsquo;t go out and eat grass, as a dog does when he is sick,
I am no female woman.&nbsp; The young lord whose hand I refused
when I took up with wise Jasper, once brought two of them to my
mother&rsquo;s tan, when hankering after my company; they did
nothing but carp at each other&rsquo;s words, and a pretty hand
they made of it.&nbsp; Ill-favoured dogs they were; and their
attempts at what they called wit almost as unfortunate as their
countenances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;madam, we will drop all
catchings and carpings for the present.&nbsp; Pray take your seat
on this stool, whilst I go and announce to Miss Isopel Berners
your arrival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon I went to Belle&rsquo;s habitation, and informed her
that Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro had paid us a visit of ceremony, and
were awaiting her at the fire-place.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray go and
tell them that I am busy,&rdquo; said Belle, who was engaged with
her needle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not feel disposed to take part in
any such nonsense.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall do no such
thing,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and I insist upon your coming
forthwith, and showing proper courtesy to your visitors.&nbsp; If
you do not, their feelings will be hurt, and you are aware that I
cannot bear that people&rsquo;s feelings should be
outraged.&nbsp; Come this moment, or&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Or what?&rdquo; said Belle, half smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
was about to say something in Armenian,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Belle, laying down her work, &ldquo;I
will come.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;your
hair is hanging about your ears, and your dress is in disorder;
you had better stay a minute or two to prepare yourself to appear
before your visitors, who have come in their very best
attire.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;I will
make no alteration in my appearance; you told me to come this
moment, and you shall be obeyed.&rdquo;&nbsp; So Belle and I
advanced towards our guests.&nbsp; As we drew nigh, Mr.
Petulengro took off his hat and made a profound obeisance to
Belle, whilst Mrs. Petulengro rose from the stool and made a
profound courtesy.&nbsp; Belle who had flung her hair back over
her shoulders, returned their salutations by bending her head,
and after slightly glancing at Mr. Petulengro, fixed her large
blue eyes full upon his wife.&nbsp; Both these females were very
handsome&mdash;but how unlike!&nbsp; Belle fair, with blue eyes
and <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>flaxen
hair; Mrs. Petulengro with olive complexion, eyes black, and hair
dark&mdash;as dark as could be.&nbsp; Belle, in demeanour calm
and proud; the gypsy graceful, but full of movement and
agitation.&nbsp; And then how different were those two in
stature!&nbsp; The head of the Romany rawnie scarcely ascended to
the breast of Isopel Berners.&nbsp; I could see that Mrs.
Petulengro gazed on Belle with unmixed admiration; so did her
husband.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;one
thing I will say, which is, that there is only one on earth
worthy to stand up in front of this she, and that is the beauty
of the world, as far as man flesh is concerned, Tawno Chikno;
what a pity he did not come down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tawno Chikno,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, flaring up;
&ldquo;a pretty fellow he to stand up in front of this
gentlewoman, a pity he didn&rsquo;t come, quotha? not at all, the
fellow is a sneak, afraid of his wife.&nbsp; He stand up against
this rawnie! why, the look she has given me would knock the
fellow down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is easier to knock him down with a look than with a
fist,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;that is, if the look
comes from a woman: not that I am disposed to doubt that this
female gentlewoman is able to knock him down either one way or
the other.&nbsp; I have heard of her often enough, and have seen
her once or twice, though not so near as now.&nbsp; Well,
ma&rsquo;am, my wife and I are come to pay our respects to you;
we are both glad to find that you have left off keeping company
with Flaming Bosville, and have taken up with my pal; he is not
very handsome, but a better&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take up with your pal, as you call him! you had
better mind what you say,&rdquo; said Isopel Berners; &ldquo;I
take up with nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I merely mean taking up your quarters with him,&rdquo;
said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;and I was only about to say a better
fellow-lodger you cannot have, or a more instructive, especially
if you have a desire to be inoculated with tongues, as he calls
them.&nbsp; I wonder whether you and he have had any tongue-work
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you and your wife anything particular to
say?&nbsp; If you have nothing but this kind of conversation I
must leave you, as I am going to make a journey this afternoon,
and should be getting ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must excuse my husband, madam,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Petulengro; &ldquo;he is not overburdened with understanding, and
has said but one word of sense since he has been here, which was
that we came to pay our respects to you.&nbsp; We have dressed
ourselves in our best Roman way, in order to do honour to you;
perhaps you do not like it; if so, I am sorry.&nbsp; I have no
French clothes, <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>madam; if I had any, madam, I would have come in them,
in order to do you more honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like to see you much better as you are,&rdquo; said
Belle; &ldquo;people should keep to their own fashions, and yours
is very pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you are pleased to think it so, madam; it has
been admired in the great city; it created what they call a
sensation, and some of the great ladies, the court ladies,
imitated it, else I should not appear in it so often as I am
accustomed; for I am not very fond of what is Roman, having an
imagination that what is Roman is ungenteel; in fact, I once
heard the wife of a rich citizen say that gypsies were vulgar
creatures.&nbsp; I should have taken her saying very much to
heart, but for her improper pronunciation; she could not
pronounce her words, madam, which we gypsies, as they call us,
usually can, so I thought she was no very high purchase.&nbsp;
You are very beautiful, madam, though you are not dressed as I
could wish to see you, and your hair is hanging down in sad
confusion; allow me to assist you in arranging your hair, madam;
I will dress it for you in our fashion; I would fain see how your
hair would look in our poor gypsy fashion; pray allow me,
madam?&rdquo; and she took Belle by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really can do no such thing,&rdquo; said Belle,
withdrawing her hand; &ldquo;I thank you for coming to see me,
but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do allow me to officiate upon your hair, madam,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Petulengro.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should esteem your allowing
me a great mark of condescension.&nbsp; You are very beautiful,
madam, and I think you doubly so, because you are so fair; I have
a great esteem for persons with fair complexions and hair; I have
a less regard for people with dark hair and complexions,
madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did you turn off the lord, and take up with
me?&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;that same lord was fair
enough all about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People do when they are young and silly what they
sometimes repent of when they are of riper years and
understandings.&nbsp; I sometimes think that had I not been
something of a simpleton, I might at this time be a great court
lady.&nbsp; Now, madam,&rdquo; said she, again taking Belle by
the hand, &ldquo;do oblige me by allowing me to plait your hair a
little?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have really a good mind to be angry with you,&rdquo;
said Belle, giving Mrs. Petulengro a peculiar glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do allow her to arrange your hair,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;she means no harm, and wishes to do you honour; do oblige
her and me too, for I should like to see how your hair would look
dressed in her fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>&ldquo;You hear what the young rye says?&rdquo; said
Mrs. Petulengro.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am sure you will oblige the young
rye, if not myself.&nbsp; Many people would be willing to oblige
the young rye, if he would but ask them; but he is not in the
habit of asking favours.&nbsp; He has a nose of his own, which he
keeps tolerably exalted; he does not think small beer of himself,
madam; and all the time I have been with him, I never heard him
ask a favour before; therefore, madam, I am sure you will oblige
him.&nbsp; My sister Ursula would be very willing to oblige him
in many things, but he will not ask her for anything, except for
such a favour as a word, which is a poor favour after all.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t mean for her word; perhaps he will some day ask you
for your word.&nbsp; If so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, here you are, after railing at me for catching at
words, catching at a word yourself,&rdquo; said Mr.
Petulengro.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, sir,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Petulengro.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt me in my
discourse; if I caught at a word now, I am not in the habit of
doing so.&nbsp; I am no conceited body; no newspaper Neddy; no
pothouse witty person.&nbsp; I was about to say, madam, that if
the young rye asks you at any time for your word, you will do as
you deem convenient; but I am sure you will oblige him by
allowing me to braid your hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not do it to oblige him,&rdquo; said Belle;
&ldquo;the young rye, as you call him, is nothing to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, to oblige me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro;
&ldquo;do allow me to become your poor tire-woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is great nonsense,&rdquo; said Belle, reddening;
&ldquo;however, as you came to see me, and ask the matter as a
particular favour to yourself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, madam,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, leading
Belle to the stool; &ldquo;please to sit down here.&nbsp; Thank
you; your hair is very beautiful, madam,&rdquo; she continued, as
she proceeded to braid Belle&rsquo;s hair; &ldquo;so is your
countenance.&nbsp; Should you ever go to the great city, among
the grand folks, you would make a sensation, madam.&nbsp; I have
made one myself, who am dark; the chi she is kauley, which last
word signifies black, which I am not, though rather dark.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s no colour like white, madam; it&rsquo;s so lasting,
so genteel.&nbsp; Gentility will carry the day, madam, even with
the young rye.&nbsp; He will ask words of the black lass, but beg
the word of the fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime Mr. Petulengro and myself entered into
conversation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Any news stirring, Mr.
Petulengro?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you heard anything
of the great religious movements?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;all the
religious people, <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>more especially the Evangelicals&mdash;those that go
about distributing tracts&mdash;are very angry about the fight
between Gentleman Cooper and White-headed Bob, which they say
ought not to have been permitted to take place; and then they are
trying all they can to prevent the fight between the lion and the
dogs, which they say is a disgrace to a Christian country.&nbsp;
Now I can&rsquo;t say that I have any quarrel with the religious
party and the Evangelicals; they are always civil to me and mine,
and frequently give us tracts, as they call them, which neither I
nor mine can read; but I cannot say that I approve of any
movements, religious or not, which have in aim to put down all
life and manly sport in this here country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are becoming vastly sharp,&rdquo; said Mr.
Petulengro; &ldquo;and I am told that all the old-fashioned
good-tempered constables are going to be set aside, and a paid
body of men to be established, who are not to permit a tramper or
vagabond on the roads of England; and talking of roads, puts me
in mind of a strange story I heard two nights ago, whilst
drinking some beer at a public-house, in company with my cousin
Sylvester.&nbsp; I had asked Tawno to go, but his wife would not
let him.&nbsp; Just opposite me, smoking their pipes, were a
couple of men, something like engineers, and they were talking of
a wonderful invention which was to make a wonderful alteration in
England; inasmuch as it would set aside all the old roads, which
in a little time would be ploughed up, and sowed with corn, and
cause all England to be laid down with iron roads, on which
people would go thundering along in vehicles, pushed forward by
fire and smoke.&nbsp; Now, brother, when I heard this, I did not
feel very comfortable; for I thought to myself, what a queer
place such a road would be to pitch one&rsquo;s tent upon, and
how impossible it would be for one&rsquo;s cattle to find a bite
of grass upon it; and I thought likewise of the danger to which
one&rsquo;s family would be exposed of being run over and
severely scorched by these same flying fiery vehicles; so I made
bold to say, that I hoped such an invention would never be
countenanced, because it was likely to do a great deal of
harm.&nbsp; Whereupon, one of the men, giving me a glance, said,
without taking the pipe out of his mouth, that for his part, he
sincerely hoped that it would take effect; and if it did no other
good than stopping the rambles of gypsies, and other like scamps,
it ought to be encouraged.&nbsp; Well, brother, feeling myself
insulted, I put my hand into my pocket, in order to pull out
money, intending to challenge him to fight for a five-shilling
stake, but merely <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>found sixpence, having left all my other money at the
tent; which sixpence was just sufficient to pay for the beer
which Sylvester and myself were drinking, of whom I
couldn&rsquo;t hope to borrow anything&mdash;&lsquo;poor as
Sylvester&rsquo; being a by-word amongst us.&nbsp; So, not being
able to back myself, I held my peace, and let the gorgio have it
all his own way, who, after turning up his nose at me, went on
discoursing about the said invention, saying what a fund of
profit it would be to those who knew how to make use of it, and
should have the laying down of the new roads, and the shoeing of
England with iron.&nbsp; And after he had said this, and much
more of the same kind, which I cannot remember, he and his
companion got up and walked away; and presently I and Sylvester
got up and walked to our camp; and there I lay down in my tent by
the side of my wife, where I had an ugly dream of having camped
upon an iron road; my tent being overturned by a flying vehicle;
my wife&rsquo;s leg injured; and all my affairs put into great
confusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, madam,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro, &ldquo;I have
braided your hair in our fashion: you look very beautiful, madam;
more beautiful, if possible, than before.&rdquo;&nbsp; Belle now
rose, and came forward with her tire-woman.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro
was loud in his applause, but I said nothing, for I did not think
Belle was improved in appearance by having submitted to the
ministry of Mrs. Petulengro&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; Nature never
intended Belle to appear as a gypsy; she had made her too proud
and serious.&nbsp; A more proper part for her was that of a
heroine, a queenly heroine&mdash;that of Theresa of Hungary, for
example; or, better still, that of Brynhilda the Valkyrie, the
beloved of Sigurd, the serpent-killer, who incurred the curse of
Odin, because, in the tumult of spears, she sided with the young
king, and doomed the old warrior to die, to whom Odin had
promised victory.</p>
<p>Belle looked at me for a moment in silence; then turning to
Mrs. Petulengro, she said: &ldquo;You have had your will with me;
are you satisfied?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Quite so, madam,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Petulengro, &ldquo;and I hope you will be so too, as
soon as you have looked in the glass.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
looked in one already,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;and the glass
does not flatter.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You mean the face of the
young rye,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro; &ldquo;never mind him,
madam; the young rye, though he knows a thing or two, is not a
university, nor a person of universal wisdom.&nbsp; I assure you,
that you never looked so well before; and I hope that, from this
moment, you will wear your hair in this way.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And who is to braid it in this way?&rdquo; said Belle,
smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;I, madam,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro; <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>&ldquo;I will
braid it for you every morning, if you will but be persuaded to
join us.&nbsp; Do so, madam, and I think, if you did, the young
rye would do so too.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The young rye is nothing
to me, nor I to him,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;we have stayed
some time together, but our paths will soon be apart.&nbsp; Now,
farewell, for I am about to take a journey.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And you will go out with your hair as I have braided
it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Petulengro; &ldquo;if you do, everybody will
be in love with you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Belle;
&ldquo;hitherto I have allowed you to do what you please, but
henceforth I shall have my own way.&nbsp; Come, come,&rdquo; said
she, observing that the gypsy was about to speak, &ldquo;we have
had enough of nonsense; whenever I leave this hollow, it will be
wearing my hair in my own fashion.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come,
wife,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, &ldquo;we will no longer
intrude upon the rye and rawnie; there is such a thing as being
troublesome.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon Mr. Petulengro and his wife
took their leave, with many salutations.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you
are going?&rdquo; said I, when Belle and I were left alone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;I am going on a journey; my
affairs compel me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But you will return
again?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Belle,
&ldquo;I shall return once more.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Once
more,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;what do you mean by once more?&nbsp;
The Petulengros will soon be gone, and will you abandon me in
this place?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You were alone here,&rdquo; said
Belle, &ldquo;before I came, and, I suppose, found it agreeable,
or you would not have stayed in it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that was before I knew you; but
having lived with you here, I should be very loth to live here
without you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Belle;
&ldquo;I did not know that I was of so much consequence to
you.&nbsp; Well, the day is wearing away&mdash;I must go and
harness Traveller to the cart.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will do
that,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;or anything else you may wish
me.&nbsp; Go and prepare yourself; I will see after Traveller and
the cart.&rdquo;&nbsp; Belle departed to her tent, and I set
about performing the task I had undertaken.&nbsp; In about half
an hour Belle again made her appearance&mdash;she was dressed
neatly and plainly.&nbsp; Her hair was no longer in the Roman
fashion, in which Pakomovna had plaited it, but was secured by a
comb; she held a bonnet in her hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is there
anything else I can do for you?&rdquo; I demanded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There are two or three bundles by my tent, which you can
put into the cart,&rdquo; said Belle.&nbsp; I put the bundles
into the cart, and then led Traveller and the cart up the winding
path to the mouth of the dingle, near which was Mr.
Petulengro&rsquo;s encampment.&nbsp; Belle followed.&nbsp; At the
top, I delivered the reins into her hands; we looked at each
other stedfastly for some time.&nbsp; Belle then departed, and I
returned to the dingle, where, seating myself on my stone, I
remained for upwards of an hour in thought.</p>

40</span>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the following day there was much
feasting amongst the Romany chals of Mr. Petulengro&rsquo;s
party.&nbsp; Throughout the forenoon the Romany chies did
scarcely anything but cook flesh, and the flesh which they cooked
was swine&rsquo;s flesh.&nbsp; About two o&rsquo;clock, the chals
and chies, dividing themselves into various parties, sat down and
partook of the fare, which was partly roasted, partly
sodden.&nbsp; I dined that day with Mr. Petulengro and his wife
and family, Ursula, Mr. and Mrs. Chikno, and Sylvester and his
two children.&nbsp; Sylvester, it will be as well to say, was a
widower, and had consequently no one to cook his victuals for
him, supposing he had any, which was not always the case,
Sylvester&rsquo;s affairs being seldom in a prosperous
state.&nbsp; He was noted for his bad success in trafficking,
notwithstanding the many hints which he received from Jasper,
under whose protection he had placed himself, even as Tawno
Chikno had done, who himself, as the reader has heard on a former
occasion, was anything but a wealthy subject, though he was at
all times better off than Sylvester, the Lazarus of the Romany
tribe.</p>
<p>All our party ate with a good appetite, except myself, who,
feeling rather melancholy that day, had little desire to
eat.&nbsp; I did not, like the others, partake of the pork, but
got my dinner entirely off the body of a squirrel which had been
shot the day before by a chal of the name of Piramus, who,
besides being a good shot, was celebrated for his skill in
playing on the fiddle.&nbsp; During the dinner a horn filled with
ale passed frequently around; I drank of it more than once, and
felt inspirited by the draughts.&nbsp; The repast concluded,
Sylvester and his children departed to their tent, and Mr.
Petulengro, Tawno and myself, getting up, went and lay down under
a shady hedge, where Mr. Petulengro, lighting his pipe, began to
smoke, and where Tawno presently fell asleep.&nbsp; I was about
to fall asleep also, when I heard the sound of music and
song.&nbsp; Piramus was playing on the fiddle, whilst Mrs.
Chikno, who had a voice of her own, was singing in tones sharp
enough, but of great power, a gipsy song:&mdash;</p>

<p>Which song I had translated in the following manner, in my
younger days, for a lady&rsquo;s album:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Listen to me ye Roman lads, who are seated in the
straw about the fire, and I will tell how we poison the porker, I
will tell how we poison the porker.</p>
<p><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>We go

pennies&rsquo; worth of bane, and when we return to our people,
we say we will poison the porker; we will try and poison the
porker.</p>
<p>We then make up the poison, and then we take our way to the
house of the farmer, as if to beg a bit of victuals, a little
broken victuals.</p>
<p>We see a jolly porker, and then we say in Roman language,
&ldquo;Fling the bane yonder amongst the dirt, and the porker
soon will find it, the porker soon will find it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Early on the morrow, we will return to the farm-house, and beg
the dead porker, the body of the dead porker.</p>
<p>And so we do, even so we do; the porker dieth during the
night; on the morrow we beg the porker, and carry to the tent the
porker.</p>
<p>And then we wash the inside well, till all the inside is
perfectly clean, till there&rsquo;s no bane within it, not a
poison grain within it.</p>
<p>And then we roast the body well, send for ale to the alehouse,
and have a merry banquet, a merry Roman banquet.</p>
<p>The fellow with the fiddle plays, he plays; the little lassie
sings, she sings an ancient Roman ditty; now hear the Roman
ditty.</p>

<h3>SONG OF THE BROKEN CHASTITY.<br />

But tu shan a vassavie lubbeny<br />
With gorgikie rat to be cambri.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some kernel in those songs,
brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, when the songs and music
were over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;they are certainly very
remarkable songs.&nbsp; [I translated both long ago for a
lady&rsquo;s album.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lady&rsquo;s what, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lil in which she kept bits of song and poetry to show
occasionally to young ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>&ldquo;You had no right to do that, brother; you had no
right to let the ladies into the secrets of people who took you
up when you were little better than half a fool.&nbsp; But what
did the lady say to them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I have done just now, that they were remarkable
songs, strongly expressive of the manners and peculiarities of a
remarkable people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother, she was a gentlewoman, and I forgive
you.&rdquo;]</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Jasper, I hope you have not been drabbing baulor
lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And suppose we have, brother, what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it is a very dangerous practice, to say nothing of
the wickedness of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Necessity has no law, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I have always said
so, but you are not necessitous, and should not drab
baulor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who told you we had been drabbing
baulor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you have had a banquet of pork, and after the
banquet, Mrs. Chikno sang a song about drabbing baulor, so I
naturally thought you might have lately been engaged in such a
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother, you occasionally utter a word or two of common
sense.&nbsp; It was natural for you to suppose, after seeing that
dinner of pork, and hearing that song, that we had been drabbing
baulor; I will now tell you that we have not been doing so.&nbsp;
What have you to say to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I am very glad of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you tasted that pork, brother, you would have found
that it was sweet and tasty, which balluva that is drabbed can
hardly be expected to be.&nbsp; We have no reason to drab baulor
at present, we have money and credit; but necessity has no
law.&nbsp; Our forefathers occasionally drabbed baulor; some of
our people may still do such a thing, but only from
compulsion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and at your merry meetings
you sing songs upon the compulsatory deeds of your people, alias,
their villainous actions; and, after all, what would the stirring
poetry of any nation be, but for its compulsatory deeds?&nbsp;
Look at the poetry of Scotland, the heroic part, founded almost
entirely on the villainous deeds of the Scotch nation;
cow-stealing, for example, which is very little better than
drabbing baulor; whilst the softer part is mostly about the slips
of its females among the broom, so that no upholder of Scotch
poetry could censure Ursula&rsquo;s song as indelicate, even if
he understood it.&nbsp; What do you think, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>&ldquo;I think, brother, as I before said, that
occasionally you utter a word of common sense; you were talking
of the Scotch, brother; what do you think of a Scotchman finding
fault with Romany?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Scotchman finding fault with Romany, Jasper!&nbsp; Oh
dear, but you joke, the thing could never be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and at Piramus&rsquo;s fiddle; what do you think
of a Scotchman turning up his nose at Piramus&rsquo;s
fiddle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Scotchman turning up his nose at Piramus&rsquo;s
fiddle! nonsense, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what I most dislike, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not, unless it be the constable,
Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not the constable; it&rsquo;s a beggar on
horseback, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by a beggar on horseback?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, a scamp, brother, raised above his proper place,
who takes every opportunity of giving himself fine airs.&nbsp;
About a week ago, my people and myself camped on a green by a
plantation in the neighbourhood of a great house.&nbsp; In the
evening we were making merry, the girls were dancing, while
Piramus was playing on the fiddle a tune of his own composing, to
which he has given his own name, Piramus of Rome, and which is
much celebrated amongst our people, and from which I have been
told that one of the grand gorgio composers, who once heard it,
has taken several hints.&nbsp; So, as we were making merry, a
great many grand people, lords and ladies, I believe, came from
the great house, and looked on, as the girls danced to the tune
of Piramus of Rome, and seemed much pleased; and when the girls
had left off dancing, and Piramus playing, the ladies wanted to
have their fortunes told; so I bade Mikailia Chikno, who can tell
a fortune when she pleases better than any one else, tell them a
fortune, and she, being in a good mind, told them a fortune which
pleased them very much.&nbsp; So, after they had heard their
fortunes, one of them asked if any of our women could sing; and I
told them several could, more particularly Leviathan&mdash;you
know Leviathan, she is not here now, but some miles distant; she
is our best singer, Ursula coming next.&nbsp; So the lady said
she should like to hear Leviathan sing, whereupon Leviathan sang
the Gudlo pesham, and Piramus played the tune of the same name,
which as you know, means the honeycomb, the song and the tune
being well entitled to the name, being wonderfully sweet.&nbsp;
Well, everybody present seemed mighty well pleased with the song
and music, with the exception of one person, a carroty-haired
Scotch body; how he came there I don&rsquo;t know, but there he
was; and, coming forward, <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>he began in Scotch as broad as a
barn-door to find fault with the music and the song, saying, that
he had never heard viler stuff than either.&nbsp; Well, brother,
out of consideration for the civil gentry with whom the fellow
had come, I held my peace for a long time, and in order to get
the subject changed, I said to Mikailia in Romany, you have told
the ladies their fortunes, now tell the gentlemen theirs, quick,
quick,&mdash;pen lende dukkerin.&nbsp; Well, brother, the
Scotchman, I suppose, thinking I was speaking ill of him, fell
into a greater passion than before, and catching hold of the word
dukkerin&mdash;&lsquo;Dukkerin,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;what&rsquo;s dukkerin?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Dukkerin,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;is fortune, a man or
woman&rsquo;s destiny; don&rsquo;t you like the
word?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Word! d&rsquo;ye ca&rsquo; that a word?
a bonnie word,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll
tell us what it is in Scotch,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;in order that
we may improve our language by a Scotch word; a pal of mine has
told me that we have taken a great many words from foreign
lingos.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, then, if that be the case,
fellow, I will tell you; it is e&rsquo;en
&ldquo;spaeing,&rdquo;&rsquo; said he very seriously.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll keep my own
word, which is much the prettiest&mdash;spaeing! spaeing! why, I
should be ashamed to make use of the word, it sounds so much like
a certain other word;&rsquo; and then I made a face as if I were
unwell.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s Scotch also for
that?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What do ye mean by speaking in that
guise to a gentleman?&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you insolent
vagabond, without a name or a country.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;There
you are mistaken,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;my country is Egypt, but
we &rsquo;Gyptians, like you Scotch, are rather fond of
travelling; and as for name&mdash;my name is Jasper Petulengro,
perhaps you have a better; what is it?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Sandy
Macraw.&rsquo;&nbsp; At that, brother, the gentlemen burst into a
roar of laughter, and all the ladies tittered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were rather severe on the Scotchman,
Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, brother, and suppose I were, he began
first; I am the civilest man in the world, and never interfere
with anybody, who lets me and mine alone.&nbsp; He finds fault
with Romany, forsooth! why, L&mdash;d A&rsquo;mighty,
what&rsquo;s Scotch?&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t like our songs; what
are his own?&nbsp; I understand them as little as he mine; I have
heard one or two of them, and pretty rubbish they seemed.&nbsp;
But the best of the joke is, the fellow&rsquo;s finding fault
with Piramus&rsquo;s fiddle&mdash;a chap from the land of
bagpipes finding fault with Piramus&rsquo;s fiddle!&nbsp; Why,
I&rsquo;ll back that fiddle against all the bagpipes in Scotland,
and Piramus against all the bagpipers; for though Piramus weighs
but ten stone, he shall flog a Scotchman of twenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scotchmen are never so fat as that,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;unless, indeed, <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>they have been a long time pensioners
of England.&nbsp; I say, Jasper, what remarkable names your
people have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what pretty names, brother; there&rsquo;s my own
for example, Jasper; then there&rsquo;s Ambrose and Sylvester; <a
name="citation46a"></a><a href="#footnote46a"
class="citation">[46a]</a> then there&rsquo;s Culvato, which
signifies Claude; then there&rsquo;s Piramus&mdash;that&rsquo;s a
nice name, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s your wife&rsquo;s name, Pakomovna;
then there&rsquo;s Ursula and Morella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, brother, there&rsquo;s Ercilla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ercilla! the name of the great poet of Spain, how
wonderful; then Leviathan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The name of a ship, brother; Leviathan was named after
a ship, so don&rsquo;t make a wonder out of her.&nbsp; But
there&rsquo;s Sanpriel and Synfye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, and Clementina and Lavinia, Camillia and Lydia,
Curlanda and Orlanda; wherever did they get those
names?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did my wife get her necklace, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She knows best, Jasper.&nbsp; I hope&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, no hoping!&nbsp; She got it from her grandmother,
who died at the age of 103, and sleeps in Coggeshall
churchyard.&nbsp; She got it from her mother, who also died very
old, and who could give no other account of it than that it had
been in the family time out of mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whence could they have got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, perhaps where they got their names, brother.&nbsp;
A gentleman, who had travelled much, once told me that he had
seen the sister of it about the neck of an Indian
queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of your names, Jasper, appear to be church names;
your own, for example, and Ambrose, and Sylvester; <a
name="citation46b"></a><a href="#footnote46b"
class="citation">[46b]</a> perhaps you got them from the Papists,
in the times of Popery; but where did you get such a name as
Piramus, a name of Grecian romance?&nbsp; Then some of them
appear to be Slavonian; for example, Mikailia and
Pakomovna.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know much of Slavonian;
but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is Slavonian, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The family name of certain nations, the principal of
which is the Russian, and from which the word slave is originally
derived.&nbsp; You have heard of the Russians, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother, and seen some.&nbsp; I saw their crallis
at the time of the peace; he was not a bad-looking man for a
Russian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By-the-bye, Jasper, I&rsquo;m half-inclined to think
that crallis is a Slavish word.&nbsp; I saw something like it in
a lil called Voltaire&rsquo;s <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span><i>Life of Charles</i>.&nbsp; How you
should have come by such names and words is to me
incomprehensible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem posed, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really know very little about you, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very little indeed, brother.&nbsp; We know very little
about ourselves; and you know nothing, save what we have told
you; and we have now and then told you things about us which are
not exactly true, simply to make a fool of you, brother.&nbsp;
You will say that was wrong; perhaps it was.&nbsp; Well, Sunday
will be here in a day or two, when we will go to church, where
possibly we shall hear a sermon on the disastrous consequences of
lying.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> two days had passed, Sunday
came; I breakfasted by myself in the solitary dingle; and then,
having set things a little to rights, I ascended to Mr.
Petulengro&rsquo;s encampment.&nbsp; I could hear church-bells
ringing around in the distance, appearing to say, &ldquo;Come to
church, come to church,&rdquo; as clearly as it was possible for
church-bells to say.&nbsp; I found Mr. Petulengro seated by the
door of his tent, smoking his pipe, in rather an ungenteel
undress.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, Jasper,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;are you
ready to go to church? for if you are, I am ready to accompany
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not ready, brother,&rdquo; said Mr.
Petulengro, &ldquo;nor is my wife; the church, too, to which we
shall go is three miles off; so it is of no use to think of going
there this morning, as the service would be three-quarters over
before we got there; if, however, you are disposed to go in the
afternoon, we are your people.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon I returned
to my dingle, where I passed several hours in conning the Welsh
Bible, which the preacher, Peter Williams, had given me.</p>

</a></p>
<p>At last I gave over reading, took a slight refreshment, and
was about to emerge from the dingle, when I heard the voice of
Mr. Petulengro calling me.&nbsp; I went up again to the
encampment, where I found Mr. Petulengro, his wife, and Tawno
Chikno, ready to proceed to church.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Petulengro
were dressed in Roman fashion, though not in the full-blown
manner in which they had paid their visit to Isopel and
myself.&nbsp; Tawno had on a clean white slop, with a nearly new
black beaver, with very broad rims, and the nap exceedingly
long.&nbsp; As for myself, I was dressed in much the same manner
as that in which I departed from London, having on, in honour of
the day, a shirt perfectly clean, having washed one on purpose
for the occasion, with my own hands, the day before, in the pond
of tepid water in which the newts and efts were in the habit of
taking their pleasure.&nbsp; We proceeded for upwards of a mile
by footpaths through meadows and cornfields; we crossed various
stiles; at last passing over one, we found ourselves in a road,
wending along which for a considerable distance, we at last came
in sight of a church, the bells of <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>which had been tolling distinctly in
our ears for some time; before, however, we reached the
churchyard the bells had ceased their melody.&nbsp; It was
surrounded by lofty beech-trees of brilliant green foliage.&nbsp;
We entered the gate, Mrs. Petulengro leading the way, and
proceeded to a small door near the east end of the church.&nbsp;
As we advanced, the sound of singing within the church rose upon
our ears.&nbsp; Arrived at the small door, Mrs. Petulengro opened
it and entered, followed by Tawno Chikno.&nbsp; I myself went
last of all, following Mr. Petulengro, who, before I entered,
turned round, and with a significant nod, advised me to take care
how I behaved.&nbsp; The part of the church which we had entered
was the chancel; on one side stood a number of venerable old
men&mdash;probably the neighbouring poor&mdash;and on the other a
number of poor girls belonging to the village school, dressed in
white gowns and straw bonnets, whom two elegant but simply
dressed young women were superintending.&nbsp; Every voice seemed
to be united in singing a certain anthem, which, notwithstanding
it was written neither by Tate nor Brady, contains some of the
sublimest words which were ever put together, not the worst of
which are those which burst on our ears as we entered:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Every eye shall now behold Him,<br />
Robed in dreadful majesty;<br />
Those who set at nought and sold Him,<br />
Pierced and nailed Him to the tree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deeply wailing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall the true Messiah see.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still following Mrs. Petulengro, we proceeded down the chancel
and along the aisle; notwithstanding the singing, I could
distinctly hear as we passed many a voice whispering: &ldquo;Here
come the gypsies! here come the gypsies!&rdquo;&nbsp; I felt
rather embarrassed, with a somewhat awkward doubt as to where we
were to sit; none of the occupiers of the pews, who appeared to
consist almost entirely of farmers, with their wives, sons and
daughters, opened a door to admit us.&nbsp; Mrs. Petulengro,
however, appeared to feel not the least embarrassment, but
tripped along the aisle with the greatest nonchalance.&nbsp; We
passed under the pulpit, in which stood the clergyman in his
white surplice, and reached the middle of the church, where we
were confronted by the sexton dressed in long blue coat, and
holding in his hand a wand.&nbsp; This functionary motioned
towards the lower end of the church, where were certain benches,
partly occupied by poor people and boys.&nbsp; Mrs. Petulengro,
however, with a toss of her head, directed her course <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>to a
magnificent pew, which was unoccupied, which she opened and
entered, followed closely by Tawno Chikno, Mr. Petulengro, and
myself.&nbsp; The sexton did not appear by any means to approve
of the arrangement, and as I stood next the door, laid his finger
on my arm, as if to intimate that myself and companions must quit
our aristocratical location.&nbsp; I said nothing, but directed
my eyes to the clergyman, who uttered a short and expressive
cough; the sexton looked at him for a moment, and then, bowing
his head, closed the door&mdash;in a moment more the music
ceased.&nbsp; I took up a prayer-book, on which was engraved an
earl&rsquo;s coronet.&nbsp; The clergyman uttered, &ldquo;I will
arise, and go to my father&rdquo;.&nbsp; England&rsquo;s sublime
liturgy had commenced.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Oh, what feelings came over me on finding myself again in an
edifice devoted to the religion of my country!&nbsp; I had not
been in such a place I cannot tell for how long&mdash;certainly
not for years; and now I had found my way there again, it
appeared as if I had fallen asleep in the pew of the old church
of pretty D&mdash;.&nbsp; I had occasionally done so when a
child, and had suddenly woke up.&nbsp; Yes, surely I had been
asleep and had woke up; but no! alas, no!&nbsp; I had not been
asleep&mdash;at least not in the old church; if I had been asleep
I had been walking in my sleep, struggling, striving, learning
and unlearning in my sleep.&nbsp; Years had rolled away whilst I
had been asleep&mdash;ripe fruit had fallen, green fruit had come
on whilst I had been asleep&mdash;how circumstances had altered,
and above all myself, whilst I had been asleep.&nbsp; No, I had
not been asleep in the old church!&nbsp; I was in a pew, it is
true, but not the pew of black leather, in which I sometimes fell
asleep in days of yore, but in a strange pew; and then my
companions, they were no longer those of days of yore.&nbsp; I
was no longer with my respectable father and mother, and my dear
brother, but with the gypsy cral and his wife, and the gigantic
Tawno, the Antinous of the dusky people.&nbsp; And what was I
myself?&nbsp; No longer an innocent child, but a moody man,
bearing in my face, as I knew well, the marks of my strivings and
strugglings, of what I had learnt and unlearnt; nevertheless, the
general aspect of things brought to my mind what I had felt and
seen of yore.&nbsp; There was difference enough, it is true, but
still there was a similarity&mdash;at least I thought
so&mdash;the church, the clergyman and the clerk, differing in
many respects from those of pretty D&mdash;, put me strangely in
mind of them; and then the words!&mdash;by-the-bye, was it not
the magic of the words which brought the dear enchanting past so
powerfully before the mind of Lavengro? for the words were the
same sonorous words of high import which <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>had first
made an impression on his childish ear in the old church of
pretty D&mdash;.</p>
<p>The liturgy was now over, during the reading of which my
companions behaved in a most unexceptionable manner, sitting down
and rising up when other people sat down and rose, and holding in
their hands prayer-books which they found in the pew, into which
they stared intently, though I observed that, with the exception
of Mrs. Petulengro, who knew how to read a little, they held the
books by the top, and not the bottom, as is the usual way.&nbsp;
The clergyman now ascended the pulpit, arrayed in his black
gown.&nbsp; The congregation composed themselves to attention, as
did also my companions, who fixed their eyes upon the clergyman
with a certain strange immovable stare, which I believe to be
peculiar to their race.&nbsp; The clergyman gave out his text,
and began to preach.&nbsp; He was a tall, gentlemanly man,
seemingly between fifty and sixty, with greyish hair; his
features were very handsome, but with a somewhat melancholy cast:
the tones of his voice were rich and noble, but also with
somewhat of melancholy in them.&nbsp; The text which he gave out
was the following one: &ldquo;In what would a man be profited,
provided he gained the whole world, and lost his own
soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And on this text the clergyman preached long and well: he did
not read his sermon, but spoke it extempore; his doing so rather
surprised and offended me at first; I was not used to such a
style of preaching in a church devoted to the religion of my
country.&nbsp; I compared it within my mind with the style of
preaching used by the high-church rector in the old church of
pretty D&mdash;, and I thought to myself it was very different,
and being very different I did not like it, and I thought to
myself how scandalised the people of D&mdash; would have been had
they heard it, and I figured to myself how indignant the
high-church clerk would have been had any clergyman got up in the
church of D&mdash; and preached in such a manner.&nbsp; Did it
not savour strongly of dissent, methodism, and similar low
stuff?&nbsp; Surely it did; why, the Methodist I had heard preach
on the heath above the old city, preached in the same
manner&mdash;at least he preached extempore; ay, and something
like the present clergyman; for the Methodist spoke very
zealously and with great feeling, and so did the present
clergyman; so I, of course, felt rather offended with the
clergyman for speaking with zeal and feeling.&nbsp; However, long
before the sermon was over I forgot the offence which I had
taken, and listened to the sermon with much admiration, for the
eloquence and powerful reasoning with which it abounded.</p>
<p><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>Oh, how
eloquent he was, when he talked of the inestimable value of a
man&rsquo;s soul, which he said endured for ever, whilst his
body, as every one knew, lasted at most for a very contemptible
period of time; and how forcibly he reasoned on the folly of a
man, who, for the sake of gaining the whole world&mdash;a thing,
he said, which provided he gained he could only possess for a
part of the time, during which his perishable body
existed&mdash;should lose his soul, that is, cause that precious
deathless portion of him to suffer indescribable misery time
without end.</p>
<p>There was one part of his sermon which struck me in a very
particular manner; he said: &ldquo;That there were some people
who gained something in return for their souls; if they did not
get the whole world, they got a part of it&mdash;lands, wealth,
honour, or renown; mere trifles, he allowed, in comparison with
the value of a man&rsquo;s soul, which is destined either to
enjoy delight or suffer tribulation time without end; but which,
in the eyes of the worldly, had a certain value, and which
afforded a certain pleasure and satisfaction.&nbsp; But there
were also others who lost their souls, and got nothing for
them&mdash;neither lands, wealth, renown, nor consideration, who
were poor outcasts, and despised by everybody.&nbsp; My
friends,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;if the man is a fool who barters
his soul for the whole world, what a fool he must be who barters
his soul for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyes of the clergyman, as he uttered these words, wandered
around the whole congregation; and when he had concluded them,
the eyes of the whole congregation were turned upon my companions
and myself.</p>
<h2><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> service over, my companions and
myself returned towards the encampment by the way we came.&nbsp;
Some of the humble part of the congregation laughed and joked at
us as we passed.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro and his wife, however,
returned their laughs and jokes with interest.&nbsp; As for Tawno
and myself, we said nothing: Tawno, like most handsome fellows,
having very little to say for himself at any time; and myself,
though not handsome, not being particularly skilful at
repartee.&nbsp; Some boys followed us for a considerable time,
making all kinds of observations about gypsies; but as we walked
at a great pace, we gradually left them behind, and at last lost
sight of them.&nbsp; Mrs. Petulengro and Tawno Chikno walked
together, even as they had come; whilst Mr. Petulengro and myself
followed at a little distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a very fine preacher we heard,&rdquo; said I
to Mr. Petulengro, after we had crossed the stile into the
fields.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very fine indeed, brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro;
&ldquo;he is talked of far and wide for his sermons; folks say
that there is scarcely another like him in the whole of
England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks rather melancholy, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He lost his wife several years ago, who, they say, was
one of the most beautiful women ever seen.&nbsp; They say that it
was grief for her loss that made him come out mighty strong as a
preacher; for, though he was a clergyman, he was never heard of
in the pulpit before he lost his wife; since then, the whole
country has rung with the preaching of the clergyman of M&mdash;
as they call him.&nbsp; Those two nice young gentlewomen, whom
you saw with the female childer, are his daughters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to know all about him, Jasper.&nbsp; Did you
ever hear him preach before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, brother; but he has frequently been to our tent,
and his daughters too, and given us tracts; for he is one of the
people they call Evangelicals, who give folks tracts which they
cannot read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should learn to read, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>&ldquo;We have no time, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you not frequently idle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, brother; when we are not engaged in our traffic,
we are engaged in taking our relaxation: so we have no time to
learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really should make an effort.&nbsp; If you were
disposed to learn to read, I would endeavour to assist you.&nbsp;
You would be all the better for knowing how to read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you could read the Scriptures, and, by so doing,
learn your duty towards your fellow-creatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know that already, brother; the constables and
justices have contrived to knock that tolerably into our
heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you frequently break the laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, I believe, do now and then those who know how to
read, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true, Jasper; but you really ought to learn to
read, as, by so doing, you might learn your duty towards
yourselves: and your chief duty is to take care of your own
souls; did not the preacher say: &lsquo;In what is a man
profited, provided he gain the whole world?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have not much of the world, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very little indeed, Jasper.&nbsp; Did you not observe
how the eyes of the whole congregation were turned towards our
pew when the preacher said: &lsquo;There are some people who lose
their souls, and get nothing in exchange; who are outcast,
despised, and miserable&rsquo;?&nbsp; Now was not what he said
quite applicable to the gypsies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not miserable, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, you ought to be, Jasper.&nbsp; Have you an
inch of ground of your own?&nbsp; Are you of the least use?&nbsp;
Are you not spoken ill of by everybody?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s a
gypsy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the bird noising yonder,
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bird! oh, that&rsquo;s the cuckoo tolling; but what
has the cuckoo to do with the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see, brother; what&rsquo;s the
cuckoo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? you know as much about it as myself,
Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a kind of roguish, chaffing bird,
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it is, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody knows whence it comes, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe not, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very poor, brother, not a nest of its own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they say, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>&ldquo;With every person&rsquo;s bad word,
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jasper; every person is mocking it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tolerably merry, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, tolerably merry, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of no use at all, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would be glad to get rid of the cuckoos,
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, not exactly, Jasper; the cuckoo is a pleasant,
funny bird, and its presence and voice give a great charm to the
green trees and fields; no, I can&rsquo;t say I wish exactly to
get rid of the cuckoo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, brother, what&rsquo;s a Romany chal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must answer that question yourself,
Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A roguish, chaffing fellow; a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t he,
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of no use at all, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so Jasper; I see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something very much like a cuckoo, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you are after, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would like to get rid of us, wouldn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why no; not exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are no ornament to the green lanes in spring and
summer time; are we, brother? and the voices of our chies, with
their cukkerin and dukkerin, don&rsquo;t help to make them
pleasant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see what you are at, Jasper,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would wish to turn the cuckoos into barn-door
fowls, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I should, Jasper, whatever some people
might wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the chals and chies into radical weavers and
factory wenches; hey, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say that I should, Jasper.&nbsp; You are
certainly a picturesque people, and in many respects an ornament
both to town and country; painting and lil writing too are under
great obligations to you.&nbsp; What pretty pictures are made out
of your campings and groupings, and what pretty books have been
written in which gypsies, or at least creatures intended to
represent gypsies, have been the principal figures.&nbsp; I think
if we were without you, we should begin to miss you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you would the cuckoos, if they were all
converted into barn-door fowls.&nbsp; I tell you what, brother;
frequently, as I have sat under a hedge in spring or summer time,
and heard the cuckoo, I have thought that we chals and cuckoos
are alike in <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>many respects, but especially in character.&nbsp;
Everybody speaks ill of us both, and everybody is glad to see
both of us again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jasper, but there is some difference between men
and cuckoos; men have souls, Jasper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not cuckoos, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should not talk so, Jasper; what you say is little
short of blasphemy.&nbsp; How should a bird have a
soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how should a man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we know very well that a man has a soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you take your oath of it, brother&mdash;your
bodily oath?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I think I might, Jasper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see the soul, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I never saw it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how could you swear to it?&nbsp; A pretty figure
you would make in a court of justice, to swear to a thing which
you never saw.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hold up your head, fellow.&nbsp; When
and where did you see it?&nbsp; Now upon your oath, fellow, do
you mean to say that this Roman stole the donkey&rsquo;s
foal?&rsquo;&nbsp; Oh, there&rsquo;s no one for cross-questioning
like Counsellor P&mdash;.&nbsp; Our people when they are in a
hobble always like to employ him, though he is somewhat
dear.&nbsp; Now, brother, how can you get over the &lsquo;upon
your oath, fellow, will you say that you have a
soul?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we will take no oaths on the subject; but you
yourself believe in the soul.&nbsp; I have heard you say that you
believe in dukkerin; now what is dukkerin but the soul
science?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did I say that I believed in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, after that fight, when you pointed to the bloody
mark in the cloud, whilst he you wot of was galloping in the
barouche to the old town, amidst the rain-cataracts, the thunder
and flame of heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have some kind of remembrance of it,
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, again, I heard you say that the dook of Abershaw
rode every night on horseback down the wooded hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, brother, what a wonderful memory you
have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had not, Jasper; but I can&rsquo;t help it, it
is my misfortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Misfortune! well, perhaps it is; at any rate it is very
ungenteel to have such a memory.&nbsp; I have heard my wife say
that to show you have a long memory looks very vulgar; and that
you can&rsquo;t give a greater proof of gentility than by
forgetting a thing as soon as possible&mdash;more especially a
promise, or an acquaintance <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>when he happens to be shabby.&nbsp;
Well, brother, I don&rsquo;t deny that I may have said that I
believe in dukkerin, and in Abershaw&rsquo;s dook, which you say
is his soul; but what I believe one moment, or say I believe,
don&rsquo;t be certain that I shall believe the next, or say I
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Jasper, I heard you say on a previous occasion,
on quoting a piece of a song, that when a man dies he is cast
into the earth, and there&rsquo;s an end of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, did I?&nbsp; Lor&rsquo;, what a memory you have,
brother.&nbsp; But you are not sure that I hold that opinion
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, Jasper.&nbsp; Indeed, after such a
sermon as we have been hearing, I should be very shocked if you
held such an opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, brother, don&rsquo;t be sure I do not, however
shocking such an opinion may be to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an incomprehensible people you are,
Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are rather so, brother; indeed, we have posed wiser
heads than yours before now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to care for so little, and yet you rove about
a distinct race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of our women?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have certainly very singular names,
Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Names!&nbsp; Lavengro!&nbsp; However, brother, if you
had been as fond of things as of names, you would never have been
a pal of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;n&rsquo;t they rum animals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have tongues of their own, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever feel their teeth and nails,
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, Jasper, save Mrs. Herne&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I have
always been very civil to them, so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They let you alone.&nbsp; I say, brother, some part of
the secret is in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seem rather flighty, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather fond of loose discourse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather so, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you always trust them, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We never watch them, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can always trust you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite so well as we can them.&nbsp; However, we get
on <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>very
well together, except Mikailia and her husband; but Mikailia is a
cripple, and is married to the beauty of the world, so she may be
expected to be jealous&mdash;though he would not part with her
for a duchess, no more than I would part with my rawnie, nor any
other chal with his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, but would not the chi part with the chal for a
duke, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Pakomovna gave up the duke for me,
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she occasionally talks of him, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother, but Pakomovna was born on a common not
far from the sign of the gammon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gammon of bacon, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother; but gammon likewise
means&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it does, Jasper; it means fun, ridicule, jest;
it is an ancient Norse word, and is found in the Edda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;, brother! how learned in lils you
are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many words of Norse are to be found in our vulgar
sayings, Jasper; for example&mdash;in that particularly vulgar
saying of ours, &lsquo;Your mother is up,&rsquo; there&rsquo;s a
noble Norse word; mother, there, meaning not the female who bore
us, but rage and choler, as I discovered by reading the Sagas,
Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor&rsquo;, brother! how book-learned you
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indifferently so, Jasper.&nbsp; Then you think you
might trust your wife with the duke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I could, brother, or even with
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Myself, Jasper!&nbsp; Oh, I never troubled my head
about your wife; but I suppose there have been love affairs
between gorgios and Romany chies.&nbsp; Why, novels are stuffed
with such matters; and then even one of your own songs say
so&mdash;the song which Ursula was singing the other
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is somewhat of an old song, brother, and is sung
by the chies as a warning at our solemn festivals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! but there&rsquo;s your sister-in-law, Ursula
herself, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ursula herself, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were talking of my having her, Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, brother, why didn&rsquo;t you have
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would she have had me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, brother.&nbsp; You are so much of a Roman,
and speak Romany so remarkably well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor thing! she looks very innocent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remarkably so, brother! however, though not born on the
same common with my wife, she knows a thing or two of Roman
matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>&ldquo;I should like to ask her a question or two,
Jasper, in connection with that song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can do no better, brother.&nbsp; Here we are at the
camp.&nbsp; After tea, take Ursula under a hedge, and ask her a
question or two in connection with that song.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">took</span> tea that evening with Mr.
and Mrs. Petulengro and Ursula, outside of their tent.&nbsp;
Tawno was not present, being engaged with his wife in his own
tabernacle; Sylvester was there, however, lolling listlessly upon
the ground.&nbsp; As I looked upon this man, I thought him one of
the most disagreeable fellows I had ever seen.&nbsp; His features
were ugly, and, moreover, as dark as pepper; and, besides being
dark, his skin was dirty.&nbsp; As for his dress, it was torn and
sordid.&nbsp; His chest was broad, and his arms seemed powerful;
but, upon the whole, he looked a very caitiff.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
sorry that man has lost his wife,&rdquo; thought I; &ldquo;for I
am sure he will never get another.&nbsp; What surprises me is,
that he ever found a woman disposed to unite her lot with
his!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After tea I got up and strolled about the field.&nbsp; My
thoughts were upon Isopel Berners.&nbsp; I wondered where she
was, and how long she would stay away.&nbsp; At length, becoming
tired and listless, I determined to return to the dingle, and
resume the reading of the Bible at the place where I had left
off.&nbsp; &ldquo;What better could I do,&rdquo; methought,
&ldquo;on a Sunday evening?&rdquo;&nbsp; I was then near the wood
which surrounded the dingle, but at that side which was farthest
from the encampment, which stood near the entrance.&nbsp;
Suddenly, on turning round the southern corner of the copse,
which surrounded the dingle, I perceived Ursula seated under a
thorn bush.&nbsp; I thought I never saw her look prettier than
then, dressed as she was in her Sunday&rsquo;s best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-evening, Ursula,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I little
thought to have the pleasure of seeing you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor would you, brother,&rdquo; said Ursula, &ldquo;had
not Jasper told me that you had been talking about me, and wanted
to speak to me under a hedge; so, hearing that, I watched your
motions and came here and sat down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of going to my quarters in the dingle,
to read the Bible, Ursula, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pray then, go to your quarters, brother, and read
the Miduveleskoe lil; you can speak to me under a hedge some
other time.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>&ldquo;I think I will sit down with you, Ursula; for,
after all, reading godly books in dingles at eve is rather sombre
work.&nbsp; Yes, I think I will sit down with you;&rdquo; and I
sat down by her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, brother, now you have sat down with me under the
hedge, what have you to say to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I hardly know, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not know, brother; a pretty fellow you to ask young
women to come and sit with you under hedges, and, when they come,
not know what to say to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! ah! I remember; do you know, Ursula, that I take a
great interest in you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank ye, brother; kind of you, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be exposed to a great many temptations,
Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great many indeed, brother.&nbsp; It is hard to see
fine things, such as shawls, gold watches and chains in the
shops, behind the big glasses, and to know that they are not
intended for one.&nbsp; Many&rsquo;s the time I have been tempted
to make a dash at them; but I bethought myself that by so doing I
should cut my hands, besides being almost certain of being
grabbed and sent across the gull&rsquo;s bath to the foreign
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think gold and fine things temptations,
Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, brother, very great temptations; don&rsquo;t
you think them so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I do, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then more fool you, brother; but have the kindness to
tell me what you would call a temptation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, for example, the hope of honour and renown,
Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hope of honour and renown! very good, brother; but
I tell you one thing, that unless you have money in your pocket,
and good broad-cloth on your back, you are not likely to obtain
much honour and&mdash;what do you call it? amongst the gorgios,
to say nothing of the Romany chals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have thought, Ursula, that the Romany chals,
roaming about the world as they do, free and independent, were
above being led by such trifles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you know nothing of the gypsies, brother; no
people on earth are fonder of those trifles, as you call them,
than the Romany chals, and more disposed to respect those who
have them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then money and fine clothes would induce you to
anything, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, brother, anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To chore, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>&ldquo;Like enough, brother; gypsies have been
transported before now for choring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To hokkawar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay; I was telling dukkerin only yesterday,
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact, to break the law in everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows, brother, who knows?&nbsp; As I said before,
gold and fine clothes are great temptations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ursula, I am sorry for it, I should never have
thought you so depraved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think that I am seated by one who is willing
to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To play the thief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The liar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the lubbeny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The what, brother?&rdquo; said Ursula, starting from
her seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the lubbeny; don&rsquo;t you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you what, brother,&rdquo; said Ursula, looking
somewhat pale, and speaking very low, &ldquo;if I had only
something in my hand, I would do you a mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what is the matter, Ursula?&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;how have I offended you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How have you offended me?&nbsp; Why, didn&rsquo;t you
insinivate just now that I was ready to play
the&mdash;the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the&mdash;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not say it; but I
only wish I had something in my hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I have offended, Ursula, I am very sorry for it; any
offence I may have given you was from want of understanding
you.&nbsp; Come, pray be seated, I have much to question you
about&mdash;to talk to you about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seated, not I!&nbsp; It was only just now that you gave
me to understand that you was ashamed to be seated by me, a
thief, a liar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, did you not almost give me to understand that you
were both, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t much care being called a thief and a
liar,&rdquo; said Ursula; &ldquo;a person may be a liar and a
thief, and yet a very honest woman, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>&ldquo;I tell you what, brother, if you ever sinivate
again that I could be the third thing, so help me duvel!
I&rsquo;ll do you a mischief.&nbsp; By my God I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ursula, I assure you that I shall sinivate, as
you call it, nothing of the kind about you.&nbsp; I have no
doubt, from what you have said, that you are a very paragon of
virtue&mdash;a perfect Lucretia; but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Ursula, brother, and not Lucretia: Lucretia
is not of our family, but one of the Bucklands; she travels about
Oxfordshire; yet I am as good as she any day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucretia! how odd!&nbsp; Where could she have got that
name?&nbsp; Well, I make no doubt, Ursula, that you are quite as
good as she, and she as her namesake of ancient Rome; but there
is a mystery in this same virtue, Ursula, which I cannot fathom;
how a thief and a liar should be able, or indeed willing, to
preserve her virtue is what I don&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; You
confess that you are very fond of gold.&nbsp; Now, how is it that
you don&rsquo;t barter your virtue for gold sometimes?&nbsp; I am
a philosopher, Ursula, and like to know everything.&nbsp; You
must be every now and then exposed to great temptation, Ursula;
for you are of a beauty calculated to captivate all hearts.&nbsp;
Come, sit down and tell me how you are enabled to resist such a
temptation as gold and fine clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, brother,&rdquo; said Ursula, &ldquo;as you say
you mean no harm, I will sit down beside you, and enter into
discourse with you; but I will uphold that you are the coolest
hand that I ever came nigh, and say the coolest
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thereupon Ursula sat down by my side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ursula, we will, if you please, discourse on the
subject of your temptations.&nbsp; I suppose that you travel very
much about, and show yourself in all kinds of places?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In all kinds, brother; I travels, as you say, very much
about, attends fairs and races, and enters booths and
public-houses, where I tells fortunes, and sometimes dances and
sings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do not people often address you in a very free
manner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frequently, brother; and I give them tolerably free
answers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do people ever offer to make you presents?&nbsp; I mean
presents of value, such as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silk handkerchiefs, shawls and trinkets; very
frequently, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you do, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I takes what people offers me, brother, and stows it
away as soon as I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>&ldquo;Well, but don&rsquo;t people expect something for
their presents?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean dukkerin, dancing and
the like; but such a moderate and innocent thing as a choomer,
Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Innocent thing, do you call it, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world calls it so, Ursula.&nbsp; Well, do the
people who give you the fine things never expect a choomer in
return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very frequently, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you ever grant it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you avoid it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gets away as soon as possible, brother.&nbsp; If they
follows me, I tries to baffle them by means of jests and
laughter; and if they persist, I uses bad and terrible language,
of which I have plenty in store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if your terrible language has no effect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I screams for the constable, and if he comes not,
I uses my teeth and nails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are they always sufficient?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have only had to use them twice, brother; but then I
found them sufficient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose the person who followed you was highly
agreeable, Ursula?&nbsp; A handsome young officer of local
militia, for example, all dressed in Lincoln green, would you
still refuse him the choomer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We makes no difference, brother; the daughters of the
gypsy father makes no difference; and what&rsquo;s more, sees
none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Ursula, the world will hardly give you credit for
such indifference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What cares we for the world, brother! we are not of the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your fathers, brothers and uncles give you credit,
I suppose, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, brother, our fathers, brothers and cokos gives
us all manner of credit; for example, I am telling lies and
dukkerin in a public-house where my batu or coko&mdash;perhaps
both&mdash;are playing on the fiddle; well, my batu and my coko
beholds me amongst the public-house crew, talking nonsense and
hearing nonsense; but they are under no apprehension; and
presently they sees the good-looking officer of militia, in his
greens and Lincolns, get up and give me a wink, and I go out with
him abroad, into the dark night perhaps; well, my batu and my
coko goes on fiddling just as if I were six miles off asleep in
the tent, and not out in the dark street with the local officer,
with his Lincolns and his greens.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>&ldquo;They know they can trust you, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, brother; and, what&rsquo;s more, I knows I can
trust myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you would merely go out to make a fool of him,
Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merely go out to make a fool of him, brother, I assure
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But such proceedings really have an odd look,
Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amongst gorgios, very so, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it must be rather unpleasant to lose one&rsquo;s
character even amongst gorgios, Ursula; and suppose the officer,
out of revenge for being tricked and duped by you, were to say of
you the thing that is not, were to meet you on the race-course
the next day, and boast of receiving favours which he never had,
amidst a knot of jeering militiamen, how would you proceed,
Ursula? would you not be abashed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means, brother; I should bring my action of law
against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your action at law, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother, I should give a whistle, whereupon all
one&rsquo;s cokos and batus, and all my near and distant
relations, would leave their fiddling, dukkerin and
horse-dealing, and come flocking about me.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Ursula?&rsquo; says my
coko.&nbsp; &lsquo;Nothing at all,&rsquo; I replies, &lsquo;save
and except that gorgio, in his greens and his Lincolns, says that
I have played the &mdash; with him.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oho, he
does, Ursula,&rsquo; says my coko, &lsquo;try your action of law
against him, my lamb,&rsquo; and he puts something privily into
my hands; whereupon I goes close up to the grinning gorgio, and
staring him in the face, with my head pushed forward, I cries
out: &lsquo;You say I did what was wrong with you last night when
I was out with you abroad?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said
the local officer, &lsquo;I says you did,&rsquo; looking down all
the time.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are a liar,&rsquo; says I, and
forthwith I breaks his head with the stick which I holds behind
me, and which my coko has conveyed privily into my
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is your action at law, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother, this is my action at club-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And would your breaking the fellow&rsquo;s head quite
clear you of all suspicion in the eyes of your batus, cokos, and
what not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would never suspect me at all, brother, because
they would know that I would never condescend to be over-intimate
with a gorgio; the breaking the head would be merely intended to
justify Ursula in the eyes of the gorgios.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And would it clear you in their eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it not, brother?&nbsp; When they saw the blood
running <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>down from the fellow&rsquo;s cracked poll on his greens
and Lincolns, they would be quite satisfied; why, the fellow
would not be able to show his face at fair or merry-making for a
year and three-quarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever try it, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I ever did, brother, but it would
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did you ever learn such a method of
proceeding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, &rsquo;t is advised by gypsy liri, brother.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s part of our way of settling difficulties amongst
ourselves; for example, if a young Roman were to say the thing
which is not respecting Ursula and himself, Ursula would call a
great meeting of the people, who would all sit down in a ring,
the young fellow amongst them; a coko would then put a stick in
Ursula&rsquo;s hand, who would then get up and go to the young
fellow, and say, &lsquo;Did I play the &mdash; with you?&rsquo;
and were he to say &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she would crack his head
before the eyes of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Ursula, I was bred an
apprentice to gorgio law, and of course ought to stand up for it,
whenever I conscientiously can, but I must say the gypsy manner
of bringing an action for defamation is much less tedious, and
far more satisfactory, than the gorgiko one.&nbsp; I wish you now
to clear up a certain point which is rather mysterious to
me.&nbsp; You say that for a Romany chi to do what is unseemly
with a gorgio is quite out of the question, yet only the other
day I heard you singing a song in which a Romany chi confesses
herself to be cambri by a grand gorgious gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sad let down,&rdquo; said Ursula.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;sad or not, there&rsquo;s
the song that speaks of the thing, which you give me to
understand is not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if the thing ever was,&rdquo; said Ursula,
&ldquo;it was a long time ago, and perhaps, after all, not
true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why do you sing the song?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, brother, we sings the song now and
then to be a warning to ourselves to have as little to do as
possible in the way of acquaintance with the gorgios; and a
warning it is; you see how the young woman in the song was driven
out of her tent by her mother, with all kind of disgrace and bad
language; but you don&rsquo;t know that she was afterwards buried
alive by her cokos and pals in an uninhabited place; the song
doesn&rsquo;t say it, but the story says it, for there is a story
about it, though, as I said before, it was a long time ago, and
perhaps, after all, wasn&rsquo;t true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if such a thing were to happen at present, would
the cokos and pals bury the girl alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say what they would do,&rdquo; said
Ursula; &ldquo;I suppose they are not so strict as they were long
ago; at any rate, she would be driven from the tan, and avoided
by all her family and relations as a gorgio&rsquo;s acquaintance;
so that, perhaps, at last, she would be glad if they would bury
her alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can conceive that there would be an objection
on the part of the cokos and batus that a Romany chi should form
an improper acquaintance with a gorgio, but I should think that
the batus and cokos could hardly object to the chi&rsquo;s
entering into the honourable estate of wedlock with a
gorgio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ursula was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marriage is an honourable estate, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, brother, suppose it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why a Romany chi should object to
enter into the honourable estate of wedlock with a
gorgio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t, brother, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and, moreover, I am aware,
notwithstanding your evasion, Ursula, that marriages and
connections now and then occur between gorgios and Romany chies,
the result of which is the mixed breed, called half and half,
which is at present travelling about England, and to which the
Flaming Tinman belongs, otherwise called Anselo Herne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the half and halfs,&rdquo; said Ursula,
&ldquo;they are a bad set; and there is not a worse blackguard in
England than Anselo Herne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that you say may be very true, Ursula, but you
admit that there are half and halfs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more&rsquo;s the pity, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity, or not, you admit the fact; but how do you
account for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I account for it? why, I will tell you, by the
break up of a Roman family, brother&mdash;the father of a small
family dies, and, perhaps, the mother; and the poor children are
left behind; sometimes they are gathered up by their relations,
and sometimes, if they have none, by charitable Romans, who bring
them up in the observance of gypsy law; but sometimes they are
not so lucky, and falls into the company of gorgios, trampers and
basket-makers, who live in caravans, with whom they take up, and
so&mdash;I hate to talk of the matter, brother; but so comes this
race of the half and halfs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you mean to say, Ursula, that no Romany chi,
unless compelled by hard necessity would have anything to do with
a gorgio?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>&ldquo;We are not over-fond of gorgios, brother, and we
hates basket-makers, and folks that live in caravans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;suppose a gorgio who is not
a basket-maker, a fine, handsome gorgious gentleman, who lives in
a fine house&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not fond of houses, brother; I never slept in a
house in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But would not plenty of money induce you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate houses, brother, and those who live in
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose such a person were willing to resign his
fine house; and, for love of you, to adopt gypsy law, speak
Romany, and live in a tan, would you have nothing to say to
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bringing plenty of money with him, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, bringing plenty of money with him,
Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, brother, suppose you produce your man; where is
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was merely supposing such a person,
Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t know of such a person,
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, Ursula; why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, brother, I was almost beginning to think that
you meant yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Myself!&nbsp; Ursula; I have no fine house to resign;
nor have I money.&nbsp; Moreover, Ursula, though I have a great
regard for you, and though I consider you very handsome, quite as
handsome, indeed, as Meridiana in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meridiana! where did you meet with her?&rdquo; said
Ursula, with a toss of her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, in old Pulci&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At old Fulcher&rsquo;s! that&rsquo;s not true,
brother.&nbsp; Meridiana is a Borzlam, and travels with her own
people and not with old Fulcher, who is a gorgio, and a
basket-maker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not speaking of old Fulcher, but Pulci, a great
Italian writer, who lived many hundred years ago, and who, in his
poem called <i>Morgante Maggiore</i>, speaks of Meridiana, the
daughter of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Carus Borzlam,&rdquo; said Ursula; &ldquo;but if
the fellow you mention lived so many hundred years ago, how, in
the name of wonder, could he know anything of
Meridiana?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wonder, Ursula, is, how your people could ever have
got hold of that name, and similar ones.&nbsp; The Meridiana of
Pulci was not the daughter of old Carus Borzlam, but of Caradoro,
a great pagan king of the East, who, being besieged in his
capital by Manfredonio, another mighty pagan king, who wished <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>to obtain
possession of his daughter, who had refused him, was relieved in
his distress by certain paladins of Charlemagne, with one of
whom, Oliver, his daughter, Meridiana, fell in love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Ursula, &ldquo;that it must have
been altogether a different person, for I am sure that Meridiana
Borzlam would never have fallen in love with Oliver.&nbsp;
Oliver! why, that is the name of the curo-mengro, who lost the
fight near the chong gav, the day of the great tempest, when I
got wet through.&nbsp; No, no!&nbsp; Meridiana Borzlam would
never have so far forgot her blood as to take up with Tom
Oliver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not talking of that Oliver, Ursula, but of
Oliver, peer of France, and paladin of Charlemagne, with whom
Meridiana, daughter of Caradoro, fell in love, and for whose sake
she renounced her religion and became a Christian, and finally
<i>ingravidata</i>, or cambri, by him:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;E nacquene un figliuol, dice la storia,<br
/>
Che dette &agrave; Carlo-man poi gran vittoria&rsquo;;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which means&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know what it means,&rdquo; said
Ursula; &ldquo;no good, I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; Well, if the
Meridiana of Charles&rsquo;s wain&rsquo;s pal was no handsomer
than Meridiana Borzlam, she was no great catch, brother; for
though I am by no means given to vanity, I think myself better to
look at than she, though I will say she is no lubbeny, and would
scorn&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I make no doubt she would, Ursula, and I make no doubt
that you are much handsomer than she, or even the Meridiana of
Oliver.&nbsp; What I was about to say, before you interrupted me,
is this, that though I have a great regard for you, and highly
admire you, it is only in a brotherly way, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you had nothing better to say to me,&rdquo; said
Ursula, &ldquo;when you wanted to talk to me beneath a hedge,
than that you liked me in a brotherly way! well, I
declare&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem disappointed, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disappointed, brother! not I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were just now saying that you disliked gorgios, so,
of course, could only wish that I, who am a gorgio, should like
you in a brotherly way; I wished to have a conversation with you
beneath a hedge, but only with the view of procuring from you
some information respecting the song which you sung the other
day, and the conduct of Roman females, which has always struck me
as being highly unaccountable; so, if you thought anything
else&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>&ldquo;What else should I expect from a picker-up of old
words, brother?&nbsp; Bah! I dislike a picker-up of old words
worse than a picker-up of old rags.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, Ursula, I feel a great interest
in you; you are very handsome and very clever; indeed, with your
beauty and cleverness, I only wonder that you have not long since
been married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do, do you, brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; However, keep up your spirits, Ursula, you
are not much past the prime of youth, so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much past the prime of youth!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be
uncivil, brother, I was only twenty-two last month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be offended, Ursula, but twenty-two is
twenty-two, or, I should rather say, that twenty-two in a woman
is more than twenty-six in a man.&nbsp; You are still very
beautiful, but I advise you to accept the first offer
that&rsquo;s made to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, brother, but your advice comes rather late;
I accepted the first offer that was made me five years
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You married five years ago, Ursula! is it
possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite possible, brother, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how came I to know nothing about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How comes it that you don&rsquo;t know many thousand
things about the Romans, brother?&nbsp; Do you think they tell
you all their affairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Married, Ursula, married! well, I declare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem disappointed, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disappointed!&nbsp; Oh! no, not at all; but Jasper,
only a few weeks ago, told me that you were not married; and,
indeed, almost gave me to understand that you would be very glad
to get a husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you believed him?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you,
brother, for your instruction, that there is not in the whole
world a greater liar than Jasper Petulengro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to hear it, Ursula; but with respect to him
you married&mdash;who might he be?&nbsp; A gorgio, or a Romany
chal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gorgio, or Romany chal!&nbsp; Do you think I would ever
condescend to a gorgio!&nbsp; It was a Camomescro, brother, a
Lovell, a distant relation of my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where is he? and what became of him!&nbsp; Have you
any family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I am going to tell you all my
history, brother; and, to tell you the truth, I am tired of
sitting under hedges with you, talking nonsense.&nbsp; I shall go
to my house.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>&ldquo;Do sit a little longer, sister Ursula.&nbsp; I
most heartily congratulate you on your marriage.&nbsp; But where
is this same Lovell?&nbsp; I have never seen him: I wish to
congratulate him too.&nbsp; You are quite as handsome as the
Meridiana of Pulci, Ursula, ay, or the Despina of
Ricciardetto.&nbsp; Ricciardetto, Ursula, is a poem written by
one Fortiguerra, about ninety years ago, in imitation of the
Morgante of Pulci.&nbsp; It treats of the wars of Charlemagne and
his paladins with various barbarous nations, who came to besiege
Paris.&nbsp; Despina was the daughter and heiress of Scricca,
King of Cafria; she was the beloved of Ricciardetto, and was
beautiful as an angel; but I make no doubt you are quite as
handsome as she.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said Ursula&mdash;but the reply of
Ursula I reserve for another chapter, the present having attained
to rather an uncommon length, for which, however, the importance
of the matter discussed is a sufficient apology.</p>

72</span>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Brother</span>,&rdquo; said Ursula,
plucking a dandelion which grew at her feet, &ldquo;I have always
said that a more civil and pleasant-spoken person than yourself
can&rsquo;t be found.&nbsp; I have a great regard for you and
your learning, and am willing to do you any pleasure in the way
of words or conversation.&nbsp; Mine is not a very happy story,
but as you wish to hear it, it is quite at your service.&nbsp;
Launcelot Lovell made me an offer, as you call it, and we were
married in Roman fashion; that is, we gave each other our right
hands, and promised to be true to each other.&nbsp; We lived
together two years, travelling sometimes by ourselves, sometimes
with our relations; I bore him two children, both of which were
still-born, partly, I believe, from the fatigue I underwent in
running about the country telling dukkerin when I was not exactly
in a state to do so, and partly from the kicks and blows which my
husband Launcelot was in the habit of giving me every night,
provided I came home with less than five shillings, which it is
sometimes impossible to make in the country, provided no fair or
merry-making is going on.&nbsp; At the end of two years my
husband, Launcelot, whistled a horse from a farmer&rsquo;s field,
and sold it for forty pounds; and for that horse he was taken,
put in prison, tried and condemned to be sent to the other
country for life.&nbsp; Two days before he was to be sent away, I
got leave to see him in the prison, and in the presence of the
turnkey I gave him a thin cake of ginger-bread, in which there
was a dainty saw which could cut through iron.&nbsp; I then took
on wonderfully, turned my eyes inside out, fell down in a seeming
fit, and was carried out of the prison.&nbsp; That same night my
husband sawed his irons off, cut through the bars of his window,
and dropping down a height of fifty feet, lighted on his legs,
and came and joined me on a heath where I was camped alone.&nbsp;
We were just getting things ready to be off, when we heard people
coming, and sure enough they were runners after my husband,
Launcelot Lovell; for his escape had been discovered within a
quarter of an hour after he had got away.&nbsp; My husband,
without bidding me farewell, set off at full speed, and <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>they after
him, but they could not take him, and so they came back and took
me, and shook me, and threatened me, and had me before the
poknees, who shook his head at me, and threatened me in order to
make me discover where my husband was, but I said I did not know,
which was true enough; not that I would have told him if I
had.&nbsp; So at last the poknees and the runners, not being able
to make anything out of me, were obliged to let me go, and I went
in search of my husband.&nbsp; I wandered about with my cart for
several days in the direction in which I saw him run off, with my
eyes bent on the ground, but could see no marks of him; at last,
coming to four cross roads, I saw my husband&rsquo;s
patteran.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw your husband&rsquo;s patteran?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother.&nbsp; Do you know what patteran
means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Ursula; the gypsy trail, the handful of
grass which the gypsies strew in the roads as they travel, to
give information to any of their companions who may be behind, as
to the route they have taken.&nbsp; The gypsy patteran has always
had a strange interest for me, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like enough, brother; but what does patteran
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the gypsy trail, formed as I told you
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you know nothing more about patteran,
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all, Ursula; do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name for the leaf of a tree,
brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
odd enough that I have asked that question of a dozen Romany
chals and chies, and they always told me that they did not
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more they did, brother; there&rsquo;s only one
person in England that knows, and that&rsquo;s myself&mdash;the
name for a leaf is patteran.&nbsp; Now there are two that knows
it&mdash;the other is yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me, Ursula, how very strange!&nbsp; I am much
obliged to you.&nbsp; I think I never saw you look so pretty as
you do now; but who told you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother, Mrs. Herne, told it me one day, brother,
when she was in a good humour, which she very seldom was, as no
one has a better right to know than yourself, as she hated you
mortally: it was one day when you had been asking our company
what was the word for a leaf, and nobody could tell you, that she
took me aside and told me, for she was in a good humour, and
triumphed in seeing you baulked.&nbsp; She told me the word for
leaf was patteran, which our people use now for trail, having
forgotten the true meaning.&nbsp; She said that the trail was
called patteran, because the gypsies of old were in the habit of
making the marks with the leaves and branches of trees, placed in
a certain manner.&nbsp; <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>She said that nobody knew it but
herself, who was one of the old sort, and begged me never to tell
the word to any one but him I should marry; and to be
particularly cautious never to let you know it, whom she
hated.&nbsp; Well, brother, perhaps I have done wrong to tell
you; but, as I said before, I likes you, and am always ready to
do your pleasure in words and conversation; my mother, moreover,
is dead and gone, and, poor thing, will never know anything about
the matter.&nbsp; So, when I married, I told my husband about the
patteran, and we were in the habit of making our private trails
with leaves and branches of trees, which none of the other gypsy
people did; so, when I saw my husband&rsquo;s patteran, I knew it
at once, and I followed it upwards of two hundred miles towards
the north; and then I came to a deep, awful-looking water, with
an overhanging bank, and on the bank I found the patteran, which
directed me to proceed along the bank towards the east, and I
followed my husband&rsquo;s patteran towards the east; and before
I had gone half a mile, I came to a place where I saw the bank
had given way, and fallen into the deep water.&nbsp; Without
paying much heed, I passed on, and presently came to a
public-house, not far from the water, and I entered the
public-house to get a little beer, and perhaps to tell a
dukkerin, for I saw a great many people about the door; and, when
I entered, I found there was what they calls an inquest being
held upon a body in that house, and the jury had just risen to go
and look at the body; and being a woman, and having a curiosity,
I thought I would go with them, and so I did; and no sooner did I
see the body, than I knew it to be my husband&rsquo;s; it was
much swelled and altered, but I knew it partly by the clothes,
and partly by a mark on the forehead, and I cried out, &lsquo;It
is my husband&rsquo;s body,&rsquo; and I fell down in a fit, and
the fit that time, brother, was not a seeming one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how terrible!&nbsp; But
tell me, Ursula, how did your husband come by his
death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bank, overhanging the deep water, gave way under
him, brother, and he was drowned; for, like most of our people,
he could not swim, or only a little.&nbsp; The body, after it had
been in the water a long time, came up of itself, and was found
floating.&nbsp; Well, brother, when the people of the
neighbourhood found that I was the wife of the drowned man, they
were very kind to me, and made a subscription for me, with which,
after having seen my husband buried, I returned the way I had
come, till I met Jasper and his people, and with them I have
travelled ever since: I was very melancholy for a long time, I
assure you, brother; for the death of my husband preyed very much
upon my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>&ldquo;His death was certainly a very shocking one,
Ursula; but, really, if he had died a natural one, you could
scarcely have regretted it, for he appears to have treated you
barbarously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women must bear, brother; and, barring that he kicked
and beat me, and drove me out to tell dukkerin when I could
scarcely stand, he was not a bad husband.&nbsp; A man, by gypsy
law, brother, is allowed to kick and beat his wife, and to bury
her alive if he thinks proper.&nbsp; I am a gypsy, and have
nothing to say against the law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what has Mikailia Chikno to say about
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a cripple, brother, the only cripple amongst the
Roman people: so she is allowed to do and say as she
pleases.&nbsp; Moreover, her husband does not think fit to kick
or beat her, though it is my opinion she would like him all the
better if he were occasionally to do so, and threaten to bury her
alive; at any rate, she would treat him better, and respect him
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your sister does not seem to stand much in awe of
Jasper Petulengro, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the matters of my sister and Jasper Petulengro
alone, brother; you must travel in their company some time before
you can understand them; they are a strange two, up to all kind
of chaffing; but two more regular Romans don&rsquo;t breathe, and
I&rsquo;ll tell you, for your instruction, that there isn&rsquo;t
a better mare-breaker in England than Jasper Petulengro; if you
can manage Miss Isopel Berners as well as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isopel Berners,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how came you to
think of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I but think of her, brother, living as she
does with you in Mumpers&rsquo; Dingle, and travelling about with
you; you will have, brother, more difficulty to manage her, than
Jasper has to manage my sister Pakomovna.&nbsp; I should have
mentioned her before, only I wanted to know what you had to say
to me; and when we got into discourse, I forgot her.&nbsp; I say,
brother, let me tell you your dukkerin, with respect to her, you
will never&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to hear no dukkerin, Ursula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do let me tell you your dukkerin, brother, you will
never manage&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to hear no dukkerin, Ursula, in connection with
Isopel Berners.&nbsp; Moreover, it is Sunday, we will change the
subject; it is surprising to me that after all you have
undergone, you should look so beautiful.&nbsp; I suppose you do
not think of marrying again, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, brother, one husband at a time is quite enough for
any reasonable mort; especially such a good husband as I have
got.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>&ldquo;Such a good husband! why, I thought you told me
your husband was drowned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, brother, my first husband was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have you a second?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is he? in the name of wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he? why Sylvester, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do assure you, Ursula, that I feel disposed to be
angry with you; such a handsome young woman as yourself to take
up with such a nasty pepper-faced good for
nothing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hear my husband abused, brother; so you
had better say no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, is he not the Lazarus of the gypsies? has he a
penny of his own, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the more his want, brother, of a clever chi like
me to take care of him and his childer.&nbsp; I tell you what,
brother, I will chore, if necessary, and tell dukkerin for
Sylvester, if even so heavy as scarcely to be able to
stand.&nbsp; You call him lazy; you would not think him lazy if
you were in a ring with him: he is a proper man with his hands;
Jasper is going to back him for twenty pounds against Slammocks
of the Chong gav, the brother of Roarer and Bell-metal, he says
he has no doubt that he will win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you like him, I, of course, can have no
objection.&nbsp; Have you been long married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a fortnight, brother; that dinner, the other day,
when I sang the song, was given in celebration of the
wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you married in a church, Ursula?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were not, brother; none but gorgios, cripples and
lubbenys are ever married in a church: we took each other&rsquo;s
words.&nbsp; Brother, I have been with you near three hours
beneath this hedge.&nbsp; I will go to my husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he know that you are here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is he satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Satisfied! of course.&nbsp; Lor&rsquo;, you
gorgios!&nbsp; Brother, I go to my husband and my
house.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, thereupon, Ursula rose and departed.</p>
<p>After waiting a little time I also arose; it was now dark, and
I thought I could do no better than betake myself to the dingle;
at the entrance of it I found Mr. Petulengro.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
brother,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what kind of conversation have
you and Ursula had beneath the hedge?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>&ldquo;If you wished to hear what we were talking about,
you should have come and sat down beside us; you knew where we
were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, brother, I did much the same, for I went and sat
down behind you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behind the hedge, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behind the hedge, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And heard all our conversation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every word, brother; and a rum conversation it
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis an old saying, Jasper, that listeners never
hear any good of themselves; perhaps you heard the epithet that
Ursula bestowed upon you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If, by epitaph, you mean that she called me a liar, I
did, brother, and she was not much wrong, for I certainly do not
always stick exactly to truth; you, however, have not much to
complain of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You deceived me about Ursula, giving me to understand
she was not married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was not married when I told you so, brother; that
is, not to Sylvester; nor was I aware that she was going to marry
him.&nbsp; I once thought you had a kind of regard for her, and I
am sure she had as much for you as a Romany chi can have for a
gorgio.&nbsp; I half-expected to have heard you make love to her
behind the hedge, but I begin to think you care for nothing in
this world but old words and strange stories.&nbsp; Lor&rsquo;,
to take a young woman under a hedge, and talk to her as you did
to Ursula; and yet you got everything out of her that you wanted,
with your gammon about old Fulcher and Meridiana.&nbsp; You are a
cunning one, brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are mistaken, Jasper.&nbsp; I am not
cunning.&nbsp; If people think I am, it is because, being made up
of art themselves, simplicity of character is a puzzle to
them.&nbsp; Your women are certainly extraordinary creatures,
Jasper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say they were rum animals?&nbsp;
Brother, we Romans shall always stick together as long as they
stick fast to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they always will, Jasper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say, brother; nothing lasts for ever.&nbsp;
Romany chies are Romany chies still, though not exactly what they
were sixty years ago.&nbsp; My wife, though a rum one, is not
Mrs. Herne, brother.&nbsp; I think she is rather fond of
Frenchmen and French discourse.&nbsp; I tell you what, brother,
if ever gypsyism breaks up, it will be owing to our chies having
been bitten by that mad puppy they calls gentility.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">descended</span> to the bottom of the
dingle.&nbsp; It was nearly involved in obscurity.&nbsp; To
dissipate the feeling of melancholy which came over my mind, I
resolved to kindle a fire; and having heaped dry sticks upon my
hearth, and added a billet or two, I struck a light, and soon
produced a blaze.&nbsp; Sitting down, I fixed my eyes upon the
blaze, and soon fell into a deep meditation.&nbsp; I thought of
the events of the day, the scene at church, and what I had heard
at church, the danger of losing one&rsquo;s soul, the doubts of
Jasper Petulengro as to whether one had a soul.&nbsp; I thought
over the various arguments which I had either heard, or which had
come spontaneously to my mind, for or against the probability of
a state of future existence.&nbsp; They appeared to me to be
tolerably evenly balanced.&nbsp; I then thought that it was at
all events taking the safest part to conclude that there was a
soul.&nbsp; It would be a terrible thing, after having passed
one&rsquo;s life in the disbelief of the existence of a soul, to
wake up after death a soul, and to find one&rsquo;s self a lost
soul.&nbsp; Yes, methought I would come to the conclusion that
one has a soul.&nbsp; Choosing the safe side, however, appeared
to me to be playing a rather dastardly part.&nbsp; I had never
been an admirer of people who chose the safe side in everything;
indeed I had always entertained a thorough contempt for
them.&nbsp; Surely it would be showing more manhood to adopt the
dangerous side, that of disbelief; I almost resolved to do so,
but yet in a question of so much importance, I ought not to be
guided by vanity.&nbsp; The question was not which was the safe,
but the true side? yet how was I to know which was the true
side?&nbsp; Then I thought of the Bible&mdash;which I had been
reading in the morning&mdash;that spoke of the soul and a future
state; but was the Bible true?&nbsp; I had heard learned and
moral men say that it was true, but I had also heard learned and
moral men say that it was not: how was I to decide?&nbsp; Still
that balance of probabilities!&nbsp; If I could but see the way
of truth, I would follow it, if necessary, upon hands and knees;
on that I was determined; but I could not see it.&nbsp; Feeling
my brain begin to turn round, I <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>resolved to think of something else;
and forthwith began to think of what had passed between Ursula
and myself in our discourse beneath the hedge.</p>
<p>I mused deeply on what she had told me as to the virtue of the
females of her race.&nbsp; How singular that virtue must be which
was kept pure and immaculate by the possessor, whilst indulging
in habits of falsehood and dishonesty!&nbsp; I had always thought
the gypsy females extraordinary beings.&nbsp; I had often
wondered at them, their dress, their manner of speaking, and, not
least, at their names; but, until the present day, I had been
unacquainted with the most extraordinary point connected with
them.&nbsp; How came they possessed of this extraordinary virtue?
was it because they were thievish?&nbsp; I remembered that an
ancient thief-taker, who had retired from his useful calling, and
who frequently visited the office of my master at law, the
respectable S&mdash;, who had the management of his
property&mdash;I remembered to have heard this worthy, with whom
I occasionally held discourse philosophic and profound, when he
and I chanced to be alone together in the office, say that all
first-rate thieves were sober, and of well-regulated morals,
their bodily passions being kept in abeyance by their love of
gain; but this axiom could scarcely hold good with respect to
these women&mdash;however thievish they might be, they did care
for something besides gain: they cared for their husbands.&nbsp;
If they did thieve, they merely thieved for their husbands; and
though, perhaps, some of them were vain, they merely prized their
beauty because it gave them favour in the eyes of their
husbands.&nbsp; Whatever the husbands were&mdash;and Jasper had
almost insinuated that the males occasionally allowed themselves
some latitude&mdash;they appeared to be as faithful to their
husbands as the ancient Roman matrons were to theirs.&nbsp; Roman
matrons! and, after all, might not these be in reality Roman
matrons?&nbsp; They called themselves Romans; might not they be
the descendants of the old Roman matrons?&nbsp; Might not they be
of the same blood as Lucretia?&nbsp; And were not many of their
strange names&mdash;Lucretia amongst the rest&mdash;handed down
to them from old Rome?&nbsp; It is true their language was not
that of old Rome; it was not, however, altogether different from
it.&nbsp; After all, the ancient Romans might be a tribe of these
people, who settled down and founded a village with the tilts of
carts, which, by degrees, and the influx of other people, became
the grand city of the world.&nbsp; I liked the idea of the grand
city of the world owing its origin to a people who had been in
the habit of carrying their houses in their carts.&nbsp; Why,
after all, should not the Romans of history be a branch of <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>these
Romans?&nbsp; There were several points of similarity between
them; if Roman matrons were chaste, both men and women were
thieves.&nbsp; Old Rome was the thief of the world; yet still
there were difficulties to be removed before I could persuade
myself that the old Romans and my Romans were identical; and in
trying to remove these difficulties, I felt my brain once more
beginning to turn, and in haste took up another subject of
meditation, and that was the patteran, and what Ursula had told
me about it.</p>
<p>I had always entertained a strange interest for that sign by
which in their wanderings the Romanese gave to those of their
people who came behind intimation as to the direction which they
took; but it now inspired me with greater interest than
ever&mdash;now that I had learnt that the proper meaning of it
was the leaves of trees.&nbsp; I had, as I had said in my
dialogue with Ursula, been very eager to learn the word for leaf
in the Romanian language, but had never learnt it till this day;
so patteran signified leaf, the leaf of a tree; and no one at
present knew that but myself and Ursula, who had learnt it from
Mrs. Herne, the last, it was said, of the old stock; and then I
thought what strange people the gypsies must have been in the old
time.&nbsp; They were sufficiently strange at present, but they
must have been far stranger of old; they must have been a more
peculiar people&mdash;their language must have been more
perfect&mdash;and they must have had a greater stock of strange
secrets.&nbsp; I almost wished that I had lived some two or three
hundred years ago, that I might have observed these people when
they were yet stranger than at present.&nbsp; I wondered whether
I could have introduced myself to their company at that period,
whether I should have been so fortunate as to meet such a
strange, half-malicious, half-good-humoured being as Jasper, who
would have instructed me in the language, then more deserving of
note than at present.&nbsp; What might I not have done with that
language, had I known it in its purity?&nbsp; Why, I might have
written books in it; yet those who spoke it would hardly have
admitted me to their society at that period, when they kept more
to themselves.&nbsp; Yet I thought that I might possibly have
gained their confidence, and have wandered about with them, and
learnt their language, and all their strange ways, and
then&mdash;and then&mdash;and a sigh rose from the depth of my
breast; for I began to think: &ldquo;Supposing I had accomplished
all this, what would have been the profit of it; and in what
would all this wild gypsy dream have terminated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then rose another sigh, yet more profound, for I began to <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>think:
&ldquo;What was likely to be the profit of my present way of
life; the living in dingles, making pony and donkey shoes,
conversing with gypsy-women under hedges, and extracting from
them their odd secrets?&rdquo;&nbsp; What was likely to be the
profit of such a kind of life, even should it continue for a
length of time?&mdash;a supposition not very probable, for I was
earning nothing to support me, and the funds with which I had
entered upon this life were gradually disappearing.&nbsp; I was
living, it is true, not unpleasantly, enjoying the healthy air of
heaven; but, upon the whole, was I not sadly misspending my
time?&nbsp; Surely I was; and, as I looked back, it appeared to
me that I had always been doing so.&nbsp; What had been the
profit of the tongues which I had learnt? had they ever assisted
me in the day of hunger?&nbsp; No, no! it appeared to me that I
had always misspent my time, save in one instance, when by a
desperate effort I had collected all the powers of my
imagination, and written the <i>Life of Joseph Sell</i>; but even
when I wrote the <i>Life of Sell</i>, was I not in a false
position?&nbsp; Provided I had not misspent my time, would it
have been necessary to make that effort, which, after all, had
only enabled me to leave London, and wander about the country for
a time?&nbsp; But could I, taking all circumstances into
consideration, have done better than I had?&nbsp; With my
peculiar temperament and ideas, could I have pursued with
advantage the profession to which my respectable parents had
endeavoured to bring me up?&nbsp; It appeared to me that I could
not, and that the hand of necessity had guided me from my
earliest years, until the present night, in which I found myself
seated in the dingle, staring on the brands of the fire.&nbsp;
But ceasing to think of the past which, as irrecoverably gone, it
was useless to regret, even were there cause to regret it, what
should I do in future?&nbsp; Should I write another book like the
<i>Life of Joseph Sell</i>; take it to London, and offer it to a
publisher?&nbsp; But when I reflected on the grisly sufferings
which I had undergone whilst engaged in writing the <i>Life of
Sell</i>, I shrank from the idea of a similar attempt; moreover,
I doubted whether I possessed the power to write a similar
work&mdash;whether the materials for the life of another Sell
lurked within the recesses of my brain?&nbsp; Had I not better
become in reality what I had hitherto been merely playing
at&mdash;a tinker or a gypsy?&nbsp; But I soon saw that I was not
fitted to become either in reality.&nbsp; It was much more
agreeable to play the gypsy or the tinker than to become either
in reality.&nbsp; I had seen enough of gypsying and tinkering to
be convinced of that.&nbsp; All of a sudden the idea of tilling
the soil came into my head; tilling the soil was a healthful and
noble pursuit! but my <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>idea of tilling the soil had no
connection with Britain; for I could only expect to till the soil
in Britain as a serf.&nbsp; I thought of tilling it in America,
in which it was said there was plenty of wild, unclaimed land, of
which any one, who chose to clear it of its trees, might take
possession.&nbsp; I figured myself in America, in an immense
forest, clearing the land destined, by my exertions, to become a
fruitful and smiling plain.&nbsp; Methought I heard the crash of
the huge trees as they fell beneath my axe; and then I bethought
me that a man was intended to marry&mdash;I ought to marry; and
if I married, where was I likely to be more happy as a husband
and a father than in America, engaged in tilling the
ground?&nbsp; I fancied myself in America, engaged in tilling the
ground, assisted by an enormous progeny.&nbsp; Well, why not
marry, and go and till the ground in America?&nbsp; I was young,
and youth was the time to marry in, and to labour in.&nbsp; I had
the use of all my faculties; my eyes, it is true, were rather
dull from early study, and from writing the <i>Life of Joseph
Sell</i>; but I could see tolerably well with them, and they were
not bleared.&nbsp; I felt my arms, and thighs, and
teeth&mdash;they were strong and sound enough; so now was the
time to labour, to marry, eat strong flesh, and beget strong
children&mdash;the power of doing all this would pass away with
youth, which was terribly transitory.&nbsp; I bethought me that a
time would come when my eyes would be bleared, and, perhaps,
sightless; my arms and thighs strengthless and sapless; when my
teeth would shake in my jaws, even supposing they did not drop
out.&nbsp; No going a wooing then, no labouring, no eating strong
flesh, and begetting lusty children then; and I bethought me how,
when all this should be, I should bewail the days of my youth as
misspent, provided I had not in them founded for myself a home,
and begotten strong children to take care of me in the days when
I could not take care of myself; and thinking of these things, I
became sadder and sadder, and stared vacantly upon the fire till
my eyes closed in a doze.</p>
<p>I continued dozing over the fire, until rousing myself I
perceived that the brands were nearly consumed, and I thought of
retiring for the night.&nbsp; I arose, and was about to enter my
tent, when a thought struck me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo;
thought I, &ldquo;that Isopel Berners should return in the midst
of the night, how dark and dreary would the dingle appear without
a fire! truly, I will keep up the fire, and I will do more; I
have no board to spread for her, but I will fill the kettle, and
heat it, so that, if she comes, I may be able to welcome her with
a cup of tea, for I know she loves tea.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon I
piled more wood upon the fire, and soon succeeded in producing a
<a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>better
blaze than before; then, taking the kettle, I set out for the
spring.&nbsp; On arriving at the mouth of the dingle, which
fronted the east, I perceived that Charles&rsquo;s wain was
nearly opposite to it, high above in the heavens, by which I knew
that, the night was tolerably well advanced.&nbsp; The gypsy
encampment lay before me; all was hushed and still within it, and
its inmates appeared to be locked in slumber; as I advanced,
however, the dogs, which were fastened outside the tents, growled
and barked; but presently recognising me, they were again silent,
some of them wagging their tails.&nbsp; As I drew near a
particular tent, I heard a female voice say, &ldquo;Some one is
coming!&rdquo; and, as I was about to pass it, the cloth which
formed the door was suddenly lifted up, and a black head and part
of a huge naked body protruded.&nbsp; It was the head and upper
part of the giant Tawno, who, according to the fashion of gypsy
men, lay next the door wrapped in his blanket; the blanket had,
however, fallen off, and the starlight shone clear on his
athletic tawny body, and was reflected from his large staring
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only I, Tawno,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;going to
fill the kettle, as it is possible that Miss Berners may arrive
this night.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Kos-ko,&rdquo; drawled out Tawno,
and replaced the curtain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good, do you call
it?&rdquo; said the sharp voice of his wife; &ldquo;there is no
good in the matter! if that young chap were not living with the
rawnee in the illegal and uncertificated line, he would not be
getting up in the middle of the night to fill her
kettles.&rdquo;&nbsp; Passing on, I proceeded to the spring,
where I filled the kettle, and then returned to the dingle.</p>
<p>Placing the kettle upon the fire, I watched it till it began
to boil; then removing it from the top of the brands, I placed it
close beside the fire, and leaving it simmering, I retired to my
tent; where, having taken off my shoes, and a few of my garments,
I lay down on my palliasse, and was not long in falling
asleep.&nbsp; I believe I slept soundly for some time, thinking
and dreaming of nothing; suddenly, however, my sleep became
disturbed, and the subject of the patterans began to occupy my
brain.&nbsp; I imagined that I saw Ursula tracing her husband,
Launcelot Lovel, by means of his patterans; I imagined that she
had considerable difficulty in doing so; that she was
occasionally interrupted by parish beadles and constables, who
asked her whither she was travelling, to whom she gave various
answers.&nbsp; Presently methought that, as she was passing by a
farm-yard, two fierce and savage dogs flew at her; I was in great
trouble, I remember, and wished to assist her, but could not, for
though I seemed to see her, I was still at a distance: and now it
appeared that she had escaped from the dogs, and was <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>proceeding
with her cart along a gravelly path which traversed a wild moor;
I could hear the wheels grating amidst sand and gravel.&nbsp; The
next moment I was awake, and found myself sitting up in my tent;
there was a glimmer of light through the canvas caused by the
fire; a feeling of dread came over me, which was perhaps natural,
on starting suddenly from one&rsquo;s sleep in that wild, lone
place; I half-imagined that some one was nigh the tent; the idea
made me rather uncomfortable, and, to dissipate it, I lifted up
the canvas of the door and peeped out, and, lo! I had an
indistinct view of a tall figure standing by the tent &ldquo;Who
is that?&rdquo; said I, whilst I felt my blood rush to my
heart.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is I,&rdquo; said the voice of Isopel
Berners; &ldquo;you little expected me, I dare say; well, sleep
on, I do not wish to disturb you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But I was
expecting you,&rdquo; said I, recovering myself, &ldquo;as you
may see by the fire and the kettle.&nbsp; I will be with you in a
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Putting on in haste the articles of dress which I had flung
off, I came out of the tent, and addressing myself to Isopel, who
was standing beside her cart, I said: &ldquo;Just as I was about
to retire to rest I thought it possible that you might come
to-night, and got everything in readiness for you.&nbsp; Now, sit
down by the fire whilst I lead the donkey and cart to the place
where you stay; I will unharness the animal, and presently come
and join you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I need not trouble you,&rdquo;
said Isopel; &ldquo;I will go myself and see after my
things.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We will go together,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;and then return and have some tea.&rdquo;&nbsp; Isopel
made no objection, and in about half an hour we had arranged
everything at her quarters.&nbsp; I then hastened and prepared
tea.&nbsp; Presently Isopel rejoined me, bringing her stool; she
had divested herself of her bonnet, and her hair fell over her
shoulders; she sat down, and I poured out the beverage, handing
her a cup.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you made a long journey
to-night?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;A very long one,&rdquo;
replied Belle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have come nearly twenty miles since
six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe I heard you
coming in my sleep,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;did the dogs above bark
at you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Isopel, &ldquo;very
violently; did you think of me in your sleep?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I was thinking of Ursula and
something she had told me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;When and where was
that?&rdquo; said Isopel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yesterday evening,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;beneath the dingle hedge.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
you were talking with her beneath the hedge?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but only upon gypsy
matters.&nbsp; Do you know, Belle, that she has just been married
to Sylvester, so that you need not think that she and
I&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;She and you are quite at liberty to
sit where you please,&rdquo; said Isopel.&nbsp; &ldquo;However,
young man,&rdquo; she continued, dropping her tone, which she had
<a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>slightly
raised, &ldquo;I believe what you said, that you were merely
talking about gypsy matters, and also what you were going to say,
if it was, as I suppose, that she and you had no particular
acquaintance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Isopel was now silent for some
time.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you thinking of?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;how exceedingly
kind it was of you to get everything in readiness for me, though
you did not know that I should come.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I had a
presentiment that you would come,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but you
forget that I have prepared the kettle for you before, though it
was true I was then certain that you would come.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I had not forgotten your doing so, young man,&rdquo; said
Belle; &ldquo;but I was beginning to think that you were utterly
selfish, caring for nothing but the gratification of your own
selfish whims.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am very fond of having my
own way,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but utterly selfish I am not, as I
dare say I shall frequently prove to you.&nbsp; You will often
find the kettle boiling when you come home.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not heated by you,&rdquo; said Isopel, with a sigh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;By whom else?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;surely you are not
thinking of driving me away?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You have as much
right here as myself,&rdquo; said Isopel, &ldquo;as I have told
you before; but I must be going myself.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we can go together; to tell
you the truth, I am rather tired of this place.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Our paths must be separate,&rdquo; said Belle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Separate,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;what do you mean?&nbsp; I
shan&rsquo;t let you go alone, I shall go with you; and you know
the road is as free to me as to you; besides, you can&rsquo;t
think of parting company with me, considering how much you would
lose by doing so; remember that you know scarcely anything of the
Armenian language; now, to learn Armenian from me would take you
twenty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belle faintly smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;take another cup of tea.&rdquo;&nbsp; Belle took another
cup of tea, and yet another; we had some indifferent
conversation, after which I arose and gave her donkey a
considerable feed of corn.&nbsp; Belle thanked me, shook me by
the hand, and then went to her own tabernacle, and I returned to
mine.</p>
<h2><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the following morning, after
breakfasting with Belle, who was silent and melancholy, I left
her in the dingle, and took a stroll amongst the neighbouring
lanes.&nbsp; After some time I thought I would pay a visit to the
landlord of the public-house, whom I had not seen since the day
when he communicated to me his intention of changing his
religion.&nbsp; I therefore directed my steps to the house, and
on entering it found the landlord standing in the kitchen.&nbsp;
Just then two mean-looking fellows, who had been drinking at one
of the tables, and who appeared to be the only customers in the
house, got up, brushed past the landlord, and saying in a surly
tone, we shall pay you some time or other, took their
departure.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way they serve me
now,&rdquo; said the landlord with a sigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you
know those fellows,&rdquo; I demanded, &ldquo;since you let them
go away in your debt?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I know nothing about
them,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;save that they are a
couple of scamps.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then why did you let them
go away without paying you?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I had not
the heart to stop them,&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;and to
tell you the truth, everybody serves me so now, and I suppose
they are right, for a child could flog me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;behave more like a man,
and with respect to those two fellows run after them, I will go
with you, and if they refuse to pay the reckoning I will help you
to shake some money out of their clothes.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;but as they
are gone, let them go on.&nbsp; What they have drank is not of
much consequence.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the matter with
you?&rdquo; said I, staring at the landlord, who appeared
strangely altered; his features were wild and haggard, his
formerly bluff cheeks were considerably sunken in, and his figure
had lost much of its plumpness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you changed
your religion already, and has the fellow in black commanded you
to fast?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have not changed my religion
yet,&rdquo; said the landlord with a kind of shudder; &ldquo;I am
to change it publicly this day fortnight, and the idea of doing
so&mdash;I do not mind telling you&mdash;preys much upon my mind;
<a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>moreover,
the noise of the thing has got abroad, and everybody is laughing
at me, and what&rsquo;s more, coming and drinking my beer, and
going away without paying for it, whilst I feel myself like one
bewitched, wishing but not daring to take my own part.&nbsp;
Confound the fellow in black, I wish I had never seen him! yet
what can I do without him?&nbsp; The brewer swears that unless I
pay him fifty pounds within a fortnight he&rsquo;ll send a
distress warrant into the house, and take all I have.&nbsp; My
poor niece is crying in the room above; and I am thinking of
going into the stable and hanging myself; and perhaps it&rsquo;s
the best thing I can do, for it&rsquo;s better to hang myself
before selling my soul than afterwards, as I&rsquo;m sure I
should, like Judas Iscariot, whom my poor niece, who is somewhat
religiously inclined, has been talking to me about.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I wish I could assist you,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;with
money, but that is quite out of my power.&nbsp; However, I can
give you a piece of advice.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t change your
religion by any means; you can&rsquo;t hope to prosper if you do;
and if the brewer chooses to deal hardly with you, let him.&nbsp;
Everybody would respect you ten times more provided you allowed
yourself to be turned into the roads rather than change your
religion, than if you got fifty pounds for renouncing
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am half-inclined to take your
advice,&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;only, to tell you the
truth, I feel quite low, without any heart in me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come into the bar,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and let us have
something together&mdash;you need not be afraid of my not paying
for what I order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went into the bar-room, where the landlord and I discussed
between us two bottles of strong ale, which he said were part of
the last six which he had in his possession.&nbsp; At first he
wished to drink sherry, but I begged him to do no such thing,
telling him that sherry would do him no good under the present
circumstances; nor, indeed, to the best of my belief, under any,
it being of all wines the one for which I entertained the most
contempt.&nbsp; The landlord allowed himself to be dissuaded, and
after a glass or two of ale, confessed that sherry was a sickly,
disagreeable drink, and that he had merely been in the habit of
taking it from an idea he had that it was genteel.&nbsp; Whilst
quaffing our beverage, he gave me an account of the various
mortifications to which he had of late been subject, dwelling
with particular bitterness on the conduct of Hunter, who he said
came every night and mouthed him, and afterwards went away
without paying for what he had drank or smoked, in which conduct
he was closely imitated by a clan of fellows who constantly
attended him.&nbsp; After spending several hours at the
public-house I departed, <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>not forgetting to pay for the two
bottles of ale.&nbsp; The landlord, before I went, shaking me by
the hand, declared that he had now made up his mind to stick to
his religion at all hazards, the more especially as he was
convinced he should derive no good by giving it up.</p>
<h2><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> might be about five in the
evening when I reached the gypsy encampment.&nbsp; Here I found
Mr. Petulengro, Tawno Chikno, Sylvester and others in a great
bustle, clipping and trimming certain ponies and old horses which
they had brought with them.&nbsp; On inquiring of Jasper the
reason of their being so engaged, he informed me that they were
getting the horses ready for a fair, which was to be held on the
morrow, at a place some miles distant, at which they should
endeavour to dispose of them, adding: &ldquo;Perhaps, brother,
you will go with us, provided you have nothing better to
do?&rdquo;&nbsp; Not having any particular engagement, I assured
him that I should have great pleasure in being of the
party.&nbsp; It was agreed that we should start early on the
following morning.&nbsp; Thereupon I descended into the
dingle.&nbsp; Belle was sitting before the fire, at which the
kettle was boiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Were you waiting for me?&rdquo;
I inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;I thought
that you would come, and I waited for you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;That was very kind,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not half
so kind,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;as it was of you to get
everything ready for me in the dead of last night, when there was
scarcely a chance of my coming.&rdquo;&nbsp; The tea-things were
brought forward, and we sat down.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you been
far?&rdquo; said Belle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Merely to that
public-house,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to which you directed me on
the second day of our acquaintance.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Young men
should not make a habit of visiting public-houses,&rdquo; said
Belle; &ldquo;they are bad places.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;They may
be so to some people,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I do not think
the worst public-house in England could do me any
harm.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps you are so bad already,&rdquo;
said Belle, with a smile, &ldquo;that it would be impossible to
spoil you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How dare you catch at my
words?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;come, I will make you pay for doing
so&mdash;you shall have this evening the longest lesson in
Armenian which I have yet inflicted upon you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You may well say inflicted,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;but
pray spare me.&nbsp; I do not wish to hear anything about
Armenian, especially this evening.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why this
evening?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; Belle made no answer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will not spare you,&rdquo; said <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>I;
&ldquo;this evening I intend to make you conjugate an Armenian
verb.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, be it so,&rdquo; said Belle;
&ldquo;for this evening you shall command.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;To
command is <i>hramahyel</i>,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ram her
ill, indeed,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;I do not wish to begin
with that.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;as we
have come to the verbs, we will begin regularly; <i>hramahyel</i>
is a verb of the second conjugation.&nbsp; We will begin with the
first.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;First of all tell me,&rdquo; said
Belle, &ldquo;what a verb is?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A part of
speech,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;which, according to the dictionary,
signifies some action or passion; for example, I command you, or
I hate you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have given you no cause to hate
me,&rdquo; said Belle, looking me sorrowfully in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was merely giving two examples,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;and neither was directed at you.&nbsp; In those examples,
to command and hate are verbs.&nbsp; Belle, in Armenian there are
four conjugations of verbs; the first ends in <i>al</i>, the
second in <i>yel</i>, the third in <i>oul</i>, and the fourth in
<i>il</i>.&nbsp; Now, have you understood me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid, indeed, it will all end ill,&rdquo; said
Belle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hold your tongue,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;or
you will make me lose my patience.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You have
already made me nearly lose mine,&rdquo; said Belle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let us have no unprofitable interruptions,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;the conjugations of the Armenian verbs are neither so
numerous nor so difficult as the declensions of the nouns; hear
that, and rejoice.&nbsp; Come, we will begin with the verb
<i>hntal</i>, a verb of the first conjugation, which signifies to
rejoice.&nbsp; Come along; <i>hntam</i>, I rejoice; <i>hntas</i>,
thou rejoicest; why don&rsquo;t you follow, Belle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t rejoice, whatever you may
do,&rdquo; said Belle.&nbsp; &ldquo;The chief difficulty,
Belle,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that I find in teaching you the
Armenian grammar, proceeds from your applying to yourself and me
every example I give.&nbsp; Rejoice, in this instance, is merely
an example of an Armenian verb of the first conjugation, and has
no more to do with your rejoicing than <i>lal</i>, which is also
a verb of the first conjugation, and which signifies to weep,
would have to do with your weeping, provided I made you conjugate
it.&nbsp; Come along; <i>hntam</i>, I rejoice; <i>hntas</i>, thou
rejoicest; <i>hnt&agrave;</i>, he rejoices; <i>hntamk</i>, we
rejoice: now, repeat those words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;they sound
more like the language of horses than of human beings.&nbsp; Do
you take me for&mdash;?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For what?&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; Belle was silent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Were you going to say
mare?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mare! mare! by-the-bye, do you
know, Belle, that mare in old English stands for woman! and that
when we call a female an evil mare, the strict meaning of the
term is merely bad woman.&nbsp; So if I were to call you a mare
without <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>prefixing bad, you must not be offended.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I should though,&rdquo; said Belle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was
merely attempting to make you acquainted with a philological
fact,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;If mare, which in old English,
and likewise in vulgar English, signifies a woman, sounds the
same as mare, which in modern and polite English signifies a
female horse, I can&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; There is no such
confusion of sounds in Armenian, not, at least, in the same
instance.&nbsp; Belle, in Armenian, woman is <i>ghin</i>, the
same word, by-the-bye, as our queen, whereas mare is <i>madagh
tzi</i>, which signifies a female horse; and perhaps you will
permit me to add, that a hard-mouthed jade is, in Armenian,
<i>madagh tzi hsdierah</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear this much longer,&rdquo; said
Belle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Keep yourself quiet,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I
wish to be gentle with you; and to convince you, we will skip
<i>hntal</i>, and also for the present verbs of the first
conjugation and proceed to the second.&nbsp; Belle, I will now
select for you to conjugate the prettiest verb in Armenian; not
only of the second, but also of all the four conjugations; that
verb is <i>siriel</i>.&nbsp; Here is the present tense:
<i>siriem</i>, <i>siries</i>, <i>sir&egrave;</i>, <i>siriemk</i>,
<i>sir&egrave;k</i>, <i>sirien</i>.&nbsp; You observe that it
runs on just in the same manner as <i>hntal</i>, save and except
that the <i>e</i> is substituted for <i>a</i>; and it will be as
well to tell you that almost the only difference between the
second, third and fourth conjugations, and the first, is the
substituting in the present, preterite and other tenses, <i>e</i>
or <i>ou</i> or <i>i</i> for <i>a</i>; so you see that the
Armenian verbs are by no means difficult.&nbsp; Come on, Belle,
and say <i>siriem</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Belle hesitated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pray oblige me, Belle, by saying
<i>siriem</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Belle still appeared to
hesitate.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must admit, Belle, that it is much
softer than <i>hntam</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is so,&rdquo;
said Belle; &ldquo;and to oblige you I will say
<i>siriem</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Very well indeed,
Belle,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;No <i>vartabied</i>, or
doctor, could have pronounced it better; and now, to show you how
verbs act upon pronouns in Armenian, I will say <i>siriem
zkiez</i>.&nbsp; Please to repeat <i>siriem
zkiez</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Siriem zkiez</i>!&rdquo; said
Belle; &ldquo;that last word is very hard to say.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sorry that you think so, Belle,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now please to say <i>siri&aacute; zis</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Belle did so.&nbsp; &ldquo;Exceedingly well,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now say, <i>yerani th&egrave; sir&egrave;ir
zis</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Yerani th&egrave; sir&egrave;ir
zis</i>,&rdquo; said Belle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;you have now said, I love you&mdash;love me&mdash;ah!
would that you would love me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have said all these things?&rdquo; said
Belle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you have said them
in Armenian.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I would have said them in no
language that I understood,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;and it was
very wrong of you to take advantage of my ignorance, and make me
say such things.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;if you said them, I said them too.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You
did so,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;but I believe you were <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>merely
bantering and jeering.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;As I told you before,
Belle,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the chief difficulty which I find in
teaching you Armenian proceeds from your persisting in applying
to yourself and me every example I give.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
you meant nothing after all,&rdquo; said Belle, raising her
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us proceed,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;<i>sirietsi</i>, I loved.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You never
loved any one but yourself,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;and
what&rsquo;s more&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Sirietsits</i>, I
will love,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;<i>siriestsies</i>, thou wilt
love.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Never one so thoroughly
heartless,&rdquo; said Belle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell you what,
Belle, you are becoming intolerable, but we will change the verb;
or rather I will now proceed to tell you here, that some of the
Armenian conjugations have their anomalies; one species of these
I wish to bring before your notice.&nbsp; As old Villotte
says&mdash;from whose work I first contrived to pick up the
rudiments of Armenian&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Est verborum
transitivorum</i>, <i>quorum infinitivus</i>&mdash;&rsquo; but I
forgot, you don&rsquo;t understand Latin.&nbsp; He says there are
certain transitive verbs, whose infinitive is in
<i>outsaniel</i>; the preterite in <i>outsi</i>; the imperative
in <i>oue</i>; for example&mdash;<i>parghatsoutsaniem</i>, I
irritate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do, you do,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;and it will
be better for both of us, if you leave off doing so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would hardly believe, Belle,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;that the Armenian is in some respects closely connected
with the Irish, but so it is; for example, that word
<i>parghatsoutsaniem</i> is evidently derived from the same root
as <i>feargaim</i>, which, in Irish, is as much as to say I
vex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do, indeed,&rdquo; said Belle, sobbing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you account for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O man, man!&rdquo; said Belle, bursting into tears,
&ldquo;for what purpose do you ask a poor ignorant girl such a
question, unless it be to vex and irritate her?&nbsp; If you wish
to display your learning, do so to the wise and instructed, and
not to me, who can scarcely read or write.&nbsp; Oh, leave off
your nonsense; yet I know you will not do so, for it is the
breath of your nostrils!&nbsp; I could have wished we should have
parted in kindness, but you will not permit it.&nbsp; I have
deserved better at your hands than such treatment.&nbsp; The
whole time we have kept company together in this place, I have
scarcely had one kind word from you, but the
strangest&mdash;&rdquo; and here the voice of Belle was drowned
in her sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to see you take on so, dear Belle,&rdquo;
said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I really have given you no cause to be so
unhappy; surely teaching you a little Armenian was a very
innocent kind of diversion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you went on so long, and in such a strange
way, <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>and
made me repeat such strange examples, as you call them, that I
could not bear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to tell you the truth, Belle, it&rsquo;s my way;
and I have dealt with you just as I would with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hard-mouthed jade,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;and you
practising your horse-witchery upon her.&nbsp; I have been of an
unsubdued spirit, I acknowledge, but I was always kind to you;
and if you have made me cry, it&rsquo;s a poor thing to boast
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boast of!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;a pretty thing indeed
to boast of; I had no idea of making you cry.&nbsp; Come, I beg
your pardon; what more can I do?&nbsp; Come, cheer up,
Belle.&nbsp; You were talking of parting; don&rsquo;t let us
part, but depart, and that together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our ways lie different,&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why they should,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come, let us be off to America together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To America together?&rdquo; said Belle, looking full at
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;where we will settle down in
some forest, and conjugate the verb <i>siriel</i>
conjugally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conjugally?&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;as man and wife in America,
<i>air yew ghin</i>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are jesting, as usual,&rdquo; said Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I, indeed.&nbsp; Come, Belle, make up your mind,
and let us be off to America; and leave priests, humbug, learning
and languages behind us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you are jesting,&rdquo; said Belle;
&ldquo;but I can hardly entertain your offers; however, young
man, I thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better make up your mind, at once,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;and let us be off.&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t make a bad
husband, I assure you.&nbsp; Perhaps you think I am not worthy of
you?&nbsp; To convince you, Belle, that I am, I am ready to try a
fall with you this moment upon the grass.&nbsp; Brynhilda, the
valkyrie, swore that no one should marry her who could not fling
her down.&nbsp; Perhaps you have done the same.&nbsp; The man who
eventually married her, got a friend of his, who was called
Sigurd, the serpent-killer, to wrestle with her, disguising him
in his own armour.&nbsp; Sigurd flung her down, and won her for
his friend, though he loved her himself.&nbsp; I shall not use a
similar deceit, nor employ Jasper Petulengro to personate
me&mdash;so get up, Belle, and I will do my best to fling you
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I require no such thing of you, or anybody,&rdquo; said
Belle; &ldquo;you are beginning to look rather wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I every now and then do,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;come,
Belle, what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>&ldquo;I will say nothing at present on the
subject,&rdquo; said Belle; &ldquo;I must have time to
consider.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you please,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;to-morrow I
go to a fair with Mr. Petulengro, perhaps you will consider
whilst I am away.&nbsp; Come, Belle, let us have some more
tea.&nbsp; I wonder whether we shall be able to procure tea as
good as this in the American forest.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was about the dawn of day when I
was awakened by the voice of Mr. Petulengro shouting from the top
of the dingle, and bidding me get up.&nbsp; I arose instantly,
and dressed myself for the expedition to the fair.&nbsp; On
leaving my tent, I was surprised to observe Belle, entirely
dressed, standing close to her own little encampment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I little expected to find
you up so early.&nbsp; I suppose Jasper&rsquo;s call awakened
you, as it did me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I merely lay down in my
things,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;and have not slept during the
night.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And why did you not take off your
things and go to sleep?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did not
undress,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;because I wished to be in
readiness to bid you farewell when you departed; and as for
sleeping, I could not.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, God bless
you!&rdquo; said I, taking Belle by the hand.&nbsp; Belle made no
answer, and I observed that her hand was very cold.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is the matter with you?&rdquo; said I, looking her in
the face.&nbsp; Belle looked at me for a moment in the eyes, and
then cast down her own&mdash;her features were very pale.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are really unwell,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I had better
not go to the fair, but stay here, and take care of
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Belle, &ldquo;pray go, I
am not unwell.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then go to your tent,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;and do not endanger your health by standing abroad
in the raw morning air.&nbsp; God bless you, Belle, I shall be
home to-night, by which time I expect you will have made up your
mind; if not, another lesson in Armenian, however late the hour
be.&rdquo;&nbsp; I then wrung Belle&rsquo;s hand, and ascended to
the plain above.</p>
<p>I found the Romany party waiting for me, and everything in
readiness for departing.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro and Tawno Chikno
were mounted on two old horses.&nbsp; The rest, who intended to
go to the fair, amongst whom were two or three women, were on
foot.&nbsp; On arriving at the extremity of the plain, I looked
towards the dingle.&nbsp; Isopel Berners stood at the mouth, the
beams of the early morning sun shone full on her noble face and
figure.&nbsp; I waved my hand towards her.&nbsp; She slowly
lifted up her right arm.&nbsp; I turned away, and never saw
Isopel Berners again.</p>
<p>My companions and myself proceeded on our way.&nbsp; In about
<a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>two hours
we reached the place where the fair was to be held.&nbsp; After
breakfasting on bread and cheese and ale behind a broken stone
wall, we drove our animals to the fair.&nbsp; The fair was a
common cattle and horse fair: there was little merriment going
on, but there was no lack of business.&nbsp; By about two
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, Mr. Petulengro and his people had
disposed of their animals at what they conceived very fair
prices&mdash;they were all in high spirits, and Jasper proposed
to adjourn to a public-house.&nbsp; As we were proceeding to one,
a very fine horse, led by a jockey, made its appearance on the
ground.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro stopped short, and looked at it
steadfastly: &ldquo;Fino covar dove odoy sas miro&mdash;a fine
thing were that if it were but mine!&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If you covet it,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;why do you not
purchase it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We low gyptians never buy
animals of that description; if we did we could never sell them,
and most likely should be had up as horse-stealers.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then why did you say just now, &lsquo;It were a fine thing
if it were but yours?&rsquo;&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
gyptians always say so when we see anything that we admire.&nbsp;
An animal like that is not intended for a little hare like me,
but for some grand gentleman like yourself.&nbsp; I say, brother,
do you buy that horse!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How should I buy the
horse, you foolish person?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Buy the
horse, brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, &ldquo;if you have
not the money I can lend it you, though I be of lower
Egypt.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You talk nonsense,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;however, I wish you would ask the man the price of
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro, going up to the jockey, inquired
the price of the horse.&nbsp; The man, looking at him scornfully,
made no reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said I, going up to
the jockey, &ldquo;do me the favour to tell me the price of that
horse, as I suppose it is to sell.&rdquo;&nbsp; The jockey, who
was a surly-looking man, of about fifty, looked at me for a
moment, then, after some hesitation, said, laconically,
&ldquo;Seventy&rdquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said I, and
turned away.&nbsp; &ldquo;Buy that horse,&rdquo; said Mr.
Petulengro, coming after me; &ldquo;the dook tells me that in
less than three months he will be sold for twice
seventy.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will have nothing to do with
him,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;besides, Jasper, I don&rsquo;t like
his tail.&nbsp; Did you observe what a mean, scrubby tail he
has?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What a fool you are, brother,&rdquo;
said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;that very tail of his shows his
breeding.&nbsp; No good bred horse ever yet carried a fine
tail&mdash;&rsquo;tis your scrubby-tailed horses that are your
out-and-outers.&nbsp; Did you ever hear of Syntax, brother?&nbsp;
That tail of his puts me in mind of Syntax.&nbsp; Well, I say
nothing more, have your own way&mdash;all I wonder at is, that a
horse like him was ever brought to such a fair of dog cattle as
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>We then
made the best of our way to a public-house, where we had some
refreshment.&nbsp; I then proposed returning to the encampment,
but Mr. Petulengro declined, and remained drinking with his
companions till about six o&rsquo;clock in the evening, when
various jockeys from the fair came in.&nbsp; After some
conversation a jockey proposed a game of cards; and in a little
time, Mr. Petulengro and another gypsy sat down to play a game of
cards with two of the jockeys.</p>
<p>Though not much acquainted with cards, I soon conceived a
suspicion that the jockeys were cheating Mr. Petulengro and his
companion.&nbsp; I therefore called Mr. Petulengro aside, and
gave him a hint to that effect.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro, however,
instead of thanking me, told me to mind my own bread and butter,
and forthwith returned to his game.&nbsp; I continued watching
the players for some hours.&nbsp; The gypsies lost considerably,
and I saw clearly that the jockeys were cheating them most
confoundedly.&nbsp; I therefore once more called Mr. Petulengro
aside, and told him that the jockeys were cheating him, conjuring
him to return to the encampment.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro, who was by
this time somewhat the worse for liquor, now fell into a passion,
swore several oaths, and asking me who had made me a Moses over
him and his brethren, told me to return to the encampment by
myself.&nbsp; Incensed at the unworthy return which my well-meant
words had received, I forthwith left the house, and having
purchased a few articles of provision, I set out for the dingle
alone.&nbsp; It was a dark night when I reached it, and
descending I saw the glimmer of a fire from the depths of the
dingle; my heart beat with fond anticipation of a welcome.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Isopel Berners is waiting for me,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;and the first word that I shall hear from her lips is that
she has made up her mind.&nbsp; We shall go to America, and be so
happy together.&rdquo;&nbsp; On reaching the bottom of the
dingle, however, I saw seated near the fire, beside which stood
the kettle simmering, not Isopel Berners, but a gypsy girl, who
told me that Miss Berners when she went away had charged her to
keep up the fire, and have the kettle boiling against my
arrival.&nbsp; Startled at these words, I inquired at what hour
Isopel had left, and whither she was gone, and was told that she
had left the dingle, with her cart, about two hours after I
departed; but where she was gone she, the girl, did not
know.&nbsp; I then asked whether she had left no message, and the
girl replied that she had left none, but had merely given
directions about the kettle and fire, putting, at the same time,
sixpence into her hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very strange,&rdquo; thought
I; then dismissing the gypsy girl I sat down by the fire.&nbsp; I
had no <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>wish for tea, but sat looking on the embers, wondering
what could be the motive of the sudden departure of Isopel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Does she mean to return?&rdquo; thought I to myself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Surely she means to return,&rdquo; Hope replied, &ldquo;or
she would not have gone away without leaving any message&rdquo;;
&ldquo;and yet she could scarcely mean to return, muttered
Foreboding, or she would assuredly have left some message with
the girl.&rdquo;&nbsp; I then thought to myself what a hard thing
it would be, if, after having made up my mind to assume the yoke
of matrimony, I should be disappointed of the woman of my
choice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, after all,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;I
can scarcely be disappointed; if such an ugly scoundrel as
Sylvester had no difficulty in getting such a nice wife as
Ursula, surely I, who am not a tenth part so ugly, cannot fail to
obtain the hand of Isopel Berners, uncommonly fine damsel though
she be.&nbsp; Husbands do not grow upon hedgerows; she is merely
gone after a little business and will return
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Comforted in some degree by these hopeful imaginings, I
retired to my tent, and went to sleep.</p>
<h2><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> occurred to me of any
particular moment during the following day.&nbsp; Isopel Berners
did not return; but Mr. Petulengro and his companions came home
from the fair early in the morning.&nbsp; When I saw him, which
was about midday, I found him with his face bruised and
swelled.&nbsp; It appeared that, some time after I had left him,
he himself perceived that the jockeys with whom he was playing
cards were cheating him and his companion; a quarrel ensued,
which terminated in a fight between Mr. Petulengro and one of the
jockeys, which lasted some time, and in which Mr. Petulengro,
though he eventually came off victor, was considerably
beaten.&nbsp; His bruises, in conjunction with his pecuniary
loss, which amounted to about seven pounds, were the cause of his
being much out of humour; before night, however, he had returned
to his usual philosophic frame of mind, and, coming up to me as I
was walking about, apologised for his behaviour on the preceding
day, and assured me that he was determined, from that time
forward, never to quarrel with a friend for giving him good
advice.</p>
<p>Two more days passed, and still Isopel Berners did not
return.&nbsp; Gloomy thoughts and forebodings filled my
mind.&nbsp; During the day I wandered about the neighbouring
roads in the hopes of catching an early glimpse of her and her
returning vehicle, and at night lay awake, tossing about on my
hard couch, listening to the rustle of every leaf, and
occasionally thinking that I heard the sound of her wheels upon
the distant road.&nbsp; Once at midnight, just as I was about to
fall into unconsciousness, I suddenly started up, for I was
convinced that I heard the sound of wheels.&nbsp; I listened most
anxiously, and the sound of wheels striking against stones was
certainly plain enough.&nbsp; &ldquo;She comes at last,&rdquo;
thought I, and for a few moments I felt as if a mountain had been
removed from my breast; &ldquo;here she comes at last, now, how
shall I receive her?&nbsp; Oh,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;I will
receive her rather coolly, just as if I was not particularly
anxious about her&mdash;that&rsquo;s the way to manage these
women.&rdquo;&nbsp; The next moment <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>the sound became very loud, rather
too loud, I thought, to proceed from her wheels, and then by
degrees became fainter.&nbsp; Rushing out of my tent, I hurried
up the path to the top of the dingle, where I heard the sound
distinctly enough, but it was going from me, and evidently
proceeded from something much larger than the cart of
Isopel.&nbsp; I could, moreover, hear the stamping of a
horse&rsquo;s hoof at a lumbering trot.&nbsp; Those only whose
hopes have been wrought up to a high pitch, and then suddenly
dashed down, can imagine what I felt at that moment; and yet when
I returned to my lonely tent, and lay down on my hard pallet, the
voice of conscience told me that the misery I was then undergoing
I had fully merited, from the unkind manner in which I had
intended to receive her, when for a brief moment I supposed that
she had returned.</p>
<p>It was on the morning after this affair, and the fourth, if I
forget not, from the time of Isopel&rsquo;s departure, that, as I
was seated on my stone at the bottom of the dingle, getting my
breakfast, I heard an unknown voice from the path
above&mdash;apparently that of a person descending&mdash;exclaim:
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a strange place to bring a letter to&rdquo;;
and presently an old woman, with a belt round her middle, to
which was attached a leathern bag, made her appearance, and stood
before me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I ever!&rdquo; said she, as she looked about
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;My good gentlewoman,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;pray
what may you please to want?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gentlewoman!&rdquo; said the old dame, &ldquo;please to
want&mdash;well, I call that speaking civilly, at any rate.&nbsp;
It is true, civil words cost nothing; nevertheless, we do not
always get them.&nbsp; What I please to want is to deliver a
letter to a young man in this place; perhaps you be
he?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name on the
letter?&rdquo; said I, getting up, and going to her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is no name upon it,&rdquo; said she, taking a letter
out of her scrip, and looking at it.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is directed
to the young man in Mumpers&rsquo; Dingle.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then it is for me, I make no doubt,&rdquo; said I,
stretching out my hand to take it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Please to pay me
ninepence first,&rdquo; said the old woman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;However,&rdquo; said she, after a moment&rsquo;s thought,
&ldquo;civility is civility, and, being rather a scarce article,
should meet with some return.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the letter,
young man, and I hope you will pay for it; for if you do not I
must pay the postage myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are the
postwoman, I suppose,&rdquo; said I, as I took the letter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am the postman&rsquo;s mother,&rdquo; said the old
woman; &ldquo;but as he has a wide beat, I help him as much as I
can, and I generally carry letters to places like this, to which
he is afraid to come himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You say the
postage is ninepence,&rdquo; <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>said I; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a
shilling.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I call that
honourable,&rdquo; said the old woman, taking the shilling, and
putting it into her pocket; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s your change,
young man,&rdquo; said she, offering me threepence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pray keep that for yourself,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you
deserve it for your trouble.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I call
that genteel,&rdquo; said the old woman; &ldquo;and as one good
turn deserves another, since you look as if you couldn&rsquo;t
read, I will read your letter for you.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s see it;
it&rsquo;s from some young woman or other, I dare
say.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I
can read.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All the better for you,&rdquo; said
the old woman; &ldquo;your being able to read will frequently
save you a penny, for that&rsquo;s the charge I generally make
for reading letters; though, as you behaved so genteelly to me, I
should have charged you nothing.&nbsp; Well, if you can read, why
don&rsquo;t you open the letter, instead of keeping it hanging
between your finger and thumb?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am in no
hurry to open it,&rdquo; said I, with a sigh.&nbsp; The old woman
looked at me for a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, young man,&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;there are some&mdash;especially those who can
read&mdash;who don&rsquo;t like to open their letters when
anybody is by, more especially when they come from young
women.&nbsp; Well, I won&rsquo;t intrude upon you, but leave you
alone with your letter.&nbsp; I wish it may contain something
pleasant.&nbsp; God bless you,&rdquo; and with these words she
departed.</p>
<p>I sat down on my stone with my letter in my hand.&nbsp; I knew
perfectly well that it could have come from no other person than
Isopel Berners; but what did the letter contain?&nbsp; I guessed
tolerably well what its purport was&mdash;an eternal farewell,
yet I was afraid to open the letter, lest my expectation should
be confirmed.&nbsp; There I sat with the letter, putting off the
evil moment as long as possible.&nbsp; At length I glanced at the
direction, which was written in a fine bold hand, and was
directed, as the old woman had said, to the young man in
&ldquo;Mumpers&rsquo; Dingle,&rdquo; with the addition, near
&mdash;, in the county of &mdash;&nbsp; Suddenly the idea
occurred to me, that, after all, the letter might not contain an
eternal farewell, and that Isopel might have written, requesting
me to join her.&nbsp; Could it be so?&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas!
no,&rdquo; presently said Foreboding.&nbsp; At last I became
ashamed of my weakness.&nbsp; The letter must be opened sooner or
later.&nbsp; Why not at once?&nbsp; So as the bather who, for a
considerable time has stood shivering on the bank, afraid to take
the decisive plunge, suddenly takes it, I tore open the letter
almost before I was aware.&nbsp; I had no sooner done so than a
paper fell out.&nbsp; I examined it; it contained a lock of
bright flaxen hair.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is no good sign,&rdquo;
said I, as I thrust the lock and paper into my bosom, and
proceeded to read the letter, which ran as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span><span
class="GutSmall">&ldquo;TO THE YOUNG MAN IN MUMPERS&rsquo;
DINGLE.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I send these
lines, with the hope and trust that they will find you well, even
as I am myself at this moment, and in much better spirits, for my
own are not such as I could wish they were, being sometimes
rather hysterical and vapourish, and at other times, and most
often, very low.&nbsp; I am at a sea-port, and am just going on
shipboard; and when you get these I shall be on the salt waters,
on my way to a distant country, and leaving my own behind me,
which I do not expect ever to see again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, young man, I will, in the first place, say
something about the manner in which I quitted you.&nbsp; It must
have seemed somewhat singular to you that I went away without
taking any leave, or giving you the slightest hint that I was
going; but I did not do so without considerable reflection.&nbsp;
I was afraid that I should not be able to support a leave-taking;
and as you had said that you were determined to go wherever I
did, I thought it best not to tell you at all; for I did not
think it advisable that you should go with me, and I wished to
have no dispute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the second place, I wish to say something about an
offer of wedlock which you made me; perhaps, young man, had you
made it at the first period of our acquaintance, I should have
accepted it, but you did not, and kept putting off and putting
off, and behaving in a very strange manner, till I could stand
your conduct no longer, but determined upon leaving you and Old
England, which last step I had been long thinking about; so when
you made your offer at last, everything was arranged&mdash;my
cart and donkey engaged to be sold&mdash;and the greater part of
my things disposed of.&nbsp; However, young man, when you did
make it, I frankly tell you that I had half a mind to accept it;
at last, however, after very much consideration, I thought it
best to leave you for ever, because, for some time past, I had
become almost convinced, that, though with a wonderful deal of
learning, and exceedingly shrewd in some things, you
were&mdash;pray don&rsquo;t be offended&mdash;at the root mad!
and though mad people, I have been told, sometimes make very good
husbands, I was unwilling that your friends, if you had any,
should say that Belle Berners, the workhouse girl, took advantage
of your infirmity; for there is no concealing that I was born and
bred up in a workhouse; notwithstanding that, my blood is better
than your own, and as good as the best; you having yourself told
me that my name is a noble name, and once, if I mistake not, that
it was the same word as baron, which is the same thing as bear;
and that to be called in old times a bear was considered a great
compliment&mdash;the bear <a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>being a mighty strong animal, on
which account our forefathers called all their great fighting-men
barons, which is the same as bears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, setting matters of blood and family entirely
aside, many thanks to you, young man, from poor Belle, for the
honour you did her in making that same offer; for, after all, it
is an honour to receive an honourable offer, which she could see
clearly yours was, with no floriness nor chaff in it; but, on the
contrary, entire sincerity.&nbsp; She assures you that she shall
always bear it and yourself in mind, whether on land or water;
and as a proof of the good-will she bears to you, she sends you a
lock of the hair which she wears on her head, which you were
often looking at, and were pleased to call flax, which word she
supposes you meant as a compliment, even as the old people meant
to pass a compliment to their great folks, when they called them
bears; though she cannot help thinking that they might have found
an animal as strong as a bear, and somewhat less uncouth, to call
their great folks after: even as she thinks yourself, amongst
your great store of words, might have found something a little
more genteel to call her hair after than flax, which, though
strong and useful, is rather a coarse and common kind of
article.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as another proof of the goodwill she bears to you,
she sends you, along with the lock, a piece of advice, which is
worth all the hair in the world, to say nothing of the flax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Fear God</i>, and take your own part.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s Bible in that, young man; see how Moses feared God,
and how he took his own part against everybody who meddled with
him.&nbsp; And see how David feared God, and took his own part
against all the bloody enemies which surrounded him&mdash;so fear
God, young man, and never give in!&nbsp; The world can bully, and
is fond, provided it sees a man in a kind of difficulty, of
getting about him, calling him coarse names, and even going so
far as to hustle him: but the world, like all bullies, carries a
white feather in its tail, and no sooner sees the man taking off
his coat, and offering to fight its best, than it scatters here
and there, and is always civil to him afterwards.&nbsp; So when
folks are disposed to ill-treat you, young man, say, &lsquo;Lord
have mercy upon me!&rsquo; and then tip them Long Melford, to
which, as the saying goes, there is nothing comparable for
shortness all the world over; and these last words, young man,
are the last you will ever have from her who is nevertheless,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Your affectionate female
servant,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Isopel Berners</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>After
reading the letter I sat for some time motionless, holding it in
my hand.&nbsp; The daydream, in which I had been a little time
before indulging, of marrying Isopel Berners, of going with her
to America, and having by her a large progeny, who were to assist
me in felling trees, cultivating the soil, and who would take
care of me when I was old, was now thoroughly dispelled.&nbsp;
Isopel had deserted me, and was gone to America by herself,
where, perhaps, she would marry some other person, and would bear
him a progeny, who would do for him what in my dream I had hoped
my progeny by her would do for me.&nbsp; Then the thought came
into my head that though she was gone, I might follow her to
America, but then I thought that if I did I might not find her;
America was a very large place, and I did not know the port to
which she was bound; but I could follow her to the port from
which she had sailed, and there possibly discover the port to
which she was bound; but then I did not even know the port from
which she had set out, for Isopel had not dated her letter from
any place.&nbsp; Suddenly it occurred to me that the post-mark on
the letter would tell me from whence it came, so I forthwith
looked at the back of the letter, and in the post-mark read the
name of a well-known and not very distant sea-port.&nbsp; I then
knew with tolerable certainty the port where she had embarked,
and I almost determined to follow her, but I almost instantly
determined to do no such thing.&nbsp; Isopel Berners had
abandoned me, and I would not follow her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; whispered Pride, &ldquo;if I overtook her,
she would only despise me for running after her;&rdquo; and it
also told me pretty roundly, that, provided I ran after her,
whether I overtook her or not, I should heartily despise
myself.&nbsp; So I determined not to follow Isopel Berners.&nbsp;
I took her lock of hair, and looked at it, then put it in her
letter, which I folded up and carefully stowed away, resolved to
keep both for ever, but I determined not to follow her.&nbsp; Two
or three times, however, during the day, I wavered in my
determination, and was again and again almost tempted to follow
her, but every succeeding time the temptation was fainter.&nbsp;
In the evening I left the dingle, and sat down with Mr.
Petulengro and his family by the door of his tent; Mr. Petulengro
soon began talking of the letter which I had received in the
morning.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it not from Miss Berners,
brother?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; I told him it was.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is
she coming back, brother?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said
I; &ldquo;she is gone to America, and has deserted
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I always knew that you two were never
destined for each other,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;How did you
know that?&rdquo; I inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;The dook told me so,
brother; you are born to be a great traveller.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if I had gone with
her to America, as I was thinking of doing, I should have been a
great traveller.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are to travel in another
direction, brother,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish you would
tell me all about my future wanderings,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s a power of clouds before my
eye.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are a poor seer, after all,&rdquo;
said I; and getting up, I retired to my dingle and my tent, where
I betook myself to my bed, and there, knowing the worst, and
being no longer agitated by apprehension, nor agonised by
expectation, I was soon buried in a deep slumber, the first which
I had fallen into for several nights.</p>

106</span>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was rather late on the following
morning when I awoke.&nbsp; At first I was almost unconscious of
what had occurred on the preceding day; recollection, however, by
degrees returned, and I felt a deep melancholy coming over me,
but perfectly aware that no advantage could be derived from the
indulgence of such a feeling, I sprang up, prepared my breakfast,
which I ate with a tolerable appetite, and then left the dingle,
and betook myself to the gypsy encampment, where I entered into
discourse with various Romanies, both male and female.&nbsp;
After some time, feeling myself in better spirits, I determined
to pay another visit to the landlord of the public-house.&nbsp;
From the position of his affairs when I had last visited him, I
entertained rather gloomy ideas with respect to his present
circumstances.&nbsp; I imagined that I should either find him
alone in his kitchen smoking a wretched pipe, or in company with
some surly bailiff or his follower, whom his friend the brewer
had sent into the house in order to take possession of his
effects.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Nothing more entirely differing from either of these
anticipations could have presented itself to my view than what I
saw about one o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, when I entered the
house.&nbsp; I had come, though somewhat in want of consolation
myself, to offer any consolation which was at my command to my
acquaintance Catchpole, and perhaps like many other people who go
to a house with &ldquo;drops of compassion trembling on their
eyelids,&rdquo; I felt rather disappointed at finding that no
compassion was necessary.&nbsp; The house was thronged with
company; the cries for ale and porter, hot brandy and water, cold
gin and water, were numerous; moreover, no desire to receive and
not to pay for the landlord&rsquo;s liquids was
manifested&mdash;on the contrary, everybody seemed disposed to
play the most honourable part: &ldquo;Landlord, here&rsquo;s the
money for this glass of brandy and water&mdash;do me the favour
to take it; all right, remember I have paid you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Landlord, here&rsquo;s the money for the pint of
half-and-half&mdash;fourpence halfpenny, ain&rsquo;t
it?&mdash;here&rsquo;s sixpence; keep the change&mdash;confound
the change!&rdquo;&nbsp; The landlord, assisted by his niece,
bustled <a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>about, his brow erect, his cheeks plumped out, and all
his features exhibiting a kind of surly satisfaction.&nbsp;
Wherever he moved, marks of the most cordial amity were shown
him, hands were thrust out to grasp his, nor were looks of
respect, admiration, nay, almost of adoration, wanting.&nbsp; I
observed one fellow, as the landlord advanced, take the pipe out
of his mouth, and gaze upon him with a kind of grin of wonder,
probably much the same as his ancestor, the Saxon lout of old,
put on when he saw his idol Thur, dressed in a new kirtle.&nbsp;
To avoid the press, I got into a corner, where on a couple of
chairs sat two respectable-looking individuals, whether farmers
or sow-gelders, I know not, but highly respectable-looking, who
were discoursing about the landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;Such
another,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;you will not find in a
summer&rsquo;s day.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, nor in the whole of
England,&rdquo; said the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tom of
Hopton,&rdquo; said the first: &ldquo;ah!&nbsp; Tom of
Hopton,&rdquo; echoed the other; &ldquo;the man who could beat
Tom of Hopton could beat the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I glory
in him,&rdquo; said the first.&nbsp; &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; said
the second; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll back him against the world.&nbsp;
Let me hear any one say anything against him, and if I
don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; then, looking at me, he added:
&ldquo;Have you anything to say against him, young
man?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not a word,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;save
that he regularly puts me out.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
put any one out,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;any one out of
conceit with himself;&rdquo; then, lifting a mug to his mouth, he
added, with a hiccough, &ldquo;I drink his health.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Presently the landlord, as he moved about, observing me, stopped
short: &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are you here?&nbsp; I am
glad to see you, come this way.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Stand
back,&rdquo; said he to his company, as I followed him to the
bar, &ldquo;stand back for me and this gentleman.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Two or three young fellows were in the bar, seemingly sporting
yokels, drinking sherry and smoking.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come,
gentlemen,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;clear the bar, I must
have a clear bar for me and my friend here.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Landlord, what will you take,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;a
glass of sherry?&nbsp; I know you like it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;&mdash; sherry and you too,&rdquo; said the landlord,
&ldquo;I want neither sherry nor yourself; didn&rsquo;t you hear
what I told you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All right, old
fellow,&rdquo; said the other, shaking the landlord by the hand,
&ldquo;all right, don&rsquo;t wish to intrude&mdash;but I suppose
when you and your friend have done, I may come in again;&rdquo;
then, with &ldquo;a sarvant, sir,&rdquo; to me, he took himself
into the kitchen, followed by the rest of the sporting
yokels.</p>
<p>Thereupon the landlord, taking a bottle of ale from a basket,
uncorked it, and pouring the contents into two large glasses,
handed me one, and motioning me to sit down, placed himself by
me; then, emptying his own glass at a draught, he gave a kind <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>of grunt of
satisfaction, and fixing his eyes upon the opposite side of the
bar, remained motionless, without saying a word, buried
apparently in important cogitations.&nbsp; With respect to
myself, I swallowed my ale more leisurely, and was about to
address my friend, when his niece, coming into the bar, said that
more and more customers were arriving, and how she should supply
their wants she did not know, unless her uncle would get up and
help her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The customers!&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;let the
scoundrels wait till you have time to serve them, or till I have
leisure to see after them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The kitchen
won&rsquo;t contain half of them,&rdquo; said his niece.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then let them sit out abroad,&rdquo; said the
landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;But there are not benches enough,
uncle,&rdquo; said the niece.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then let them stand or
sit on the ground,&rdquo; said the uncle, &ldquo;what care I;
I&rsquo;ll let them know that the man who beat Tom of Hopton
stands as well again on his legs as ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
opening a side door which led from the bar into the back yard, he
beckoned me to follow him.&nbsp; &ldquo;You treat your customers
in rather a cavalier manner,&rdquo; said I, when we were alone
together in the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;ll treat them more so yet; now I have got the whiphand of
the rascals I intend to keep it.&nbsp; I daresay you are a bit
surprised with regard to the change which has come over things
since you were last here.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you how it
happened.&nbsp; You remember in what a desperate condition you
found me, thinking of changing my religion, selling my soul to
the man in black, and then going and hanging myself like Pontius
Pilate; and I daresay you can&rsquo;t have forgotten how you gave
me good advice, made me drink ale, and give up sherry.&nbsp;
Well, after you were gone, I felt all the better for your talk,
and what you had made me drink, and it was a mercy that I did
feel better; for my niece was gone out, poor thing, and I was
left alone in the house, without a soul to look at, or to keep me
from doing myself a mischief in case I was so inclined.&nbsp;
Well, things wore on in this way till it grew dusk, when in came
that blackguard Hunter with his train to drink at my expense, and
to insult me as usual; there were more than a dozen of them, and
a pretty set they looked.&nbsp; Well, they ordered about in a
very free and easy manner for upwards of an hour and a half,
occasionally sneering and jeering at me, as they had been in the
habit of doing for some time past; so, as I said before, things
wore on, and other customers came in, who, though they did not
belong to Hunter&rsquo;s gang, also passed off their jokes upon
me; for, as you perhaps <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>know, we English are a set of low
hounds, who will always take part with the many by way of making
ourselves safe, and currying favour with the stronger side.&nbsp;
I said little or nothing, for my spirits had again become very
low, and I was verily scared and afraid.&nbsp; All of a sudden I
thought of the ale which I had drank in the morning, and of the
good it did me then, so I went into the bar, opened another
bottle, took a glass, and felt better; so I took another, and
feeling better still, I went back into the kitchen, just as
Hunter and his crew were about leaving.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mr.
Hunter,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you and your people will please to
pay me for what you have had?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What do you
mean by my people?&rsquo; said he, with an oath.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah,
what do mean you by calling us his people?&rsquo; said the
clan.&nbsp; &lsquo;We are nobody&rsquo;s people;&rsquo; and then
there was a pretty load of abuse, and threatening to serve me
out.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I was perhaps wrong
to call them your people, and beg your pardon and theirs.&nbsp;
And now you will please to pay me for what you have had yourself,
and afterwards I can settle with them.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I
shall pay you when I think fit,&rsquo; said Hunter.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the rest, &lsquo;and so shall we.&nbsp;
We shall pay you when we think fit.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I tell
you what,&rsquo; said Hunter, &lsquo;I conceives I do such an old
fool as you an honour when I comes into his house and drinks his
beer, and goes away without paying for it;&rsquo; and then there
was a roar of laughter from everybody, and almost all said the
same thing.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, do you please to pay me, Mr.
Hunter?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pay you!&rsquo; said Hunter;
&lsquo;pay you!&nbsp; Yes, here&rsquo;s the pay;&rsquo; and
thereupon he held out his thumb, twirling it round till it just
touched my nose.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell you what I felt that
moment; a kind of madhouse thrill came upon me, and all I know
is, that I bent back as far as I could, then lunging out, struck
him under the ear, sending him reeling two or three yards, when
he fell on the floor.&nbsp; I wish you had but seen how my
company looked at me and at each other.&nbsp; One or two of the
clan went to raise Hunter, and get him to fight, but it was no
go; though he was not killed, he had had enough for that
evening.&nbsp; Oh, I wish you had seen my customers; those who
did not belong to the clan, but who had taken part with them, and
helped to jeer and flout me, now came and shook me by the hand,
wishing me joy, and saying as how &lsquo;I was a brave fellow,
and had served the bully right!&rsquo;&nbsp; As for the clan,
they all said Hunter was bound to do me justice; so they made him
pay me what he owed for himself, and the reckoning of those among
them who said they had no money.&nbsp; Two or three of them then
led him away, while the rest stayed behind, and flattered me, and
worshipped <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>me, and called Hunter all kinds of dogs&rsquo;
names.&nbsp; What do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it makes good what I read in
a letter which I received yesterday.&nbsp; It is just the way of
the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&rsquo;n&rsquo;t it,&rdquo; said the landlord.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, that a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t all; let me go on.&nbsp; Good
fortune never yet came alone.&nbsp; In about an hour comes home
my poor niece, almost in high sterricks with joy, smiling and
sobbing.&nbsp; She had been to the clergyman of M&mdash;, the
great preacher, to whose Church she was in the habit of going,
and to whose daughters she was well known; and to him she told a
lamentable tale about my distresses, and about the snares which
had been laid for my soul; and so well did she plead my cause,
and so strong did the young ladies back all she said, that the
good clergyman promised to stand my friend, and to lend me
sufficient money to satisfy the brewer, and to get my soul out of
the snares of the man in black; and sure enough the next morning
the two young ladies brought me the fifty pounds, which I
forthwith carried to the brewer, who was monstrously civil,
saying that he hoped any little misunderstanding we had had would
not prevent our being good friends in future.&nbsp; That
a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t all; the people of the neighbouring county
hearing as if by art witchcraft that I had licked Hunter, and was
on good terms with the brewer, forthwith began to come in crowds
to look at me, pay me homage, and be my customers.&nbsp;
Moreover, fifty scoundrels who owed me money, and who would have
seen me starve rather than help me as long as they considered me
a down pin, remembered their debts, and came and paid me more
than they owed.&nbsp; That a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t all; the brewer
being about to establish a stage-coach and three, to run across
the country, says it shall stop and change horses at my house,
and the passengers breakfast and sup as it goes and
returns.&nbsp; He wishes me&mdash;whom he calls the best man in
England&mdash;to give his son lessons in boxing, which he says he
considers a fine manly English art, and a great defence against
Popery&mdash;notwithstanding that only a month ago, when he
considered me a down pin, he was in the habit of railing against
it as a blackguard practice, and against me as a blackguard for
following it; so I am going to commence with young hopeful
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really cannot help congratulating you on your good
fortune,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t all,&rdquo; said the
landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;This very morning the folks of our parish
made me churchwarden, which they would no more have done a month
ago, when they considered me a down pin, than
they&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>&ldquo;Mercy upon us!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if fortune
pours in upon you in this manner, who knows but that within a
year they may make you justice of the peace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows, indeed!&rdquo; said the landlord.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, I will prove myself worthy of my good luck by
showing the grateful mind&mdash;not to those who would be kind to
me now, but to those who were, when the days were rather
gloomy.&nbsp; My customers shall have abundance of rough
language, but I&rsquo;ll knock any one down who says anything
against the clergyman who lent me the fifty pounds, or against
the Church of England, of which he is parson and I am
churchwarden.&nbsp; I am also ready to do anything in reason for
him who paid me for the ale he drank, when I shouldn&rsquo;t have
had the heart to collar him for the money had he refused to pay;
who never jeered or flouted me like the rest of my customers when
I was a down pin, and though he refused to fight cross <i>for</i>
me was never cross <i>with</i> me, but listened to all I had to
say, and gave me all kinds of good advice.&nbsp; Now who do you
think I mean by this last? why, who but yourself&mdash;who on
earth but yourself?&nbsp; The parson is a good man and a great
preacher, and I&rsquo;ll knock anybody down who says to the
contrary; and I mention him first, because why, he&rsquo;s a
gentleman, and you a tinker.&nbsp; But I am by no means sure you
are not the best friend of the two; for I doubt, do you see,
whether I should have had the fifty pounds but for you.&nbsp; You
persuaded me to give up that silly drink they call sherry, and
drink ale; and what was it but drinking ale which gave me courage
to knock down that fellow Hunter&mdash;and knocking him down was,
I verily believe, the turning point of my disorder.&nbsp; God
don&rsquo;t love them who won&rsquo;t strike out for themselves;
and as far as I can calculate with respect to time, it was just
the moment after I had knocked down Hunter, that the parson
consented to lend me the money, and everything began to grow
civil to me.&nbsp; So, dash my buttons if I show the ungrateful
mind to you!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t offer to knock anybody down for
you, because why&mdash;I daresay you can knock a body down
yourself; but I&rsquo;ll offer something more to the purpose; as
my business is wonderfully on the increase, I shall want somebody
to help me in serving my customers, and keeping them in
order.&nbsp; If you choose to come and serve for your board, and
what they&rsquo;ll give you, give me your fist; or if you like
ten shillings a week better than their sixpences and
ha&rsquo;pence, only say so&mdash;though, to be open with you, I
believe you would make twice ten shillings out of them&mdash;the
sneaking, fawning, curry-favouring humbugs!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>&ldquo;I am much obliged to you,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;for your handsome offer, which, however, I am obliged to
decline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; said the landlord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not fit for service,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;moreover, I am about to leave this part of the
country.&rdquo;&nbsp; As I spoke a horse neighed in the
stable.&nbsp; &ldquo;What horse is that?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It belongs to a cousin of mine, who put it into my
hands yesterday, in the hopes that I might get rid of it for him,
though he would no more have done so a week ago, when he
considered me a down pin, than he would have given the horse
away.&nbsp; Are you fond of horses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come and look at it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He led me into
the stable, where, in a stall, stood a noble-looking animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I saw this horse at
&mdash; fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like enough,&rdquo; said the landlord; &ldquo;he was
there and was offered for seventy pounds, but didn&rsquo;t find a
bidder at any price.&nbsp; What do you think of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a splendid creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am no judge of horses,&rdquo; said the landlord;
&ldquo;but I am told he&rsquo;s a first-rate trotter, good
leaper, and has some of the blood of Syntax.&nbsp; What does all
that signify?&mdash;the game is against his master, who is a down
pin, is thinking of emigrating, and wants money
confoundedly.&nbsp; He asked seventy pounds at the fair; but,
between ourselves, he would be glad to take fifty
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I almost wish,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that I were a rich
squire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would buy him then,&rdquo; said the landlord.&nbsp;
Here he mused for some time, with a very profound look.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It would be a rum thing,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if some
time or other that horse should come into your hands.&nbsp;
Didn&rsquo;t you hear how he neighed when you talked about
leaving the country?&nbsp; My granny was a wise woman, and was up
to all kinds of signs and wonders, sounds and noises, the
interpretation of the language of birds and animals, crowing and
lowing, neighing and braying.&nbsp; If she had been here, she
would have said at once that that horse was fated to carry you
away.&nbsp; On that point, however, I can say nothing, for under
fifty pounds no one can have him.&nbsp; Are you taking that money
out of your pocket to pay me for the ale?&nbsp; That won&rsquo;t
do; nothing to pay; I invited you this time.&nbsp; Now, if you
are going, you had best get into the road through the
yard-gate.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t trouble you to make your way
through the kitchen and my fine-weather company&mdash;confound
them!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> I returned along the road I met
Mr. Petulengro and one of his companions, who told me that they
were bound for the public-house; whereupon I informed Jasper how
I had seen in the stable the horse which we had admired at the
fair.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if you buy that horse
after all, brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro.&nbsp; With a
smile at the absurdity of such a supposition, I left him and his
companion, and betook myself to the dingle.&nbsp; In the evening
I received a visit from Mr. Petulengro, who forthwith commenced
talking about the horse, which he had again seen, the landlord
having shown it to him on learning that he was a friend of
mine.&nbsp; He told me that the horse pleased him more than ever,
he having examined his points with more accuracy than he had an
opportunity of doing on the first occasion, concluding by
pressing me to buy him.&nbsp; I begged him to desist from such
foolish importunity, assuring him that I had never so much money
in all my life as would enable me to purchase the horse.&nbsp;
Whilst this discourse was going on, Mr. Petulengro and myself
were standing together in the midst of the dingle.&nbsp; Suddenly
he began to move round me in a very singular manner, making
strange motions with his hands, and frightful contortions with
his features, till I became alarmed, and asked him whether he had
not lost his senses?&nbsp; Whereupon, ceasing his movements and
contortions, he assured me that he had not, but had merely been
seized with a slight dizziness, and then once more returned to
the subject of the horse.&nbsp; Feeling myself very angry, I told
him that if he continued persecuting me in that manner, I should
be obliged to quarrel with him; adding, that I believed his only
motive for asking me to buy the animal was to insult my
poverty.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pretty poverty,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;with
fifty pounds in your pocket; however, I have heard say that it is
always the custom of your rich people to talk of their poverty,
more especially when they wish to avoid laying out
money.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surprised at his saying that I had fifty
pounds in my pocket, I asked him what he meant; whereupon he told
me that he was very sure that I had fifty pounds in my pocket,
offering to lay me five shillings to that effect.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have scarcely more than the
fifth <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>part of what you say.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I know
better, brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;if you only
pull out what you have in the pocket of your slop, I am sure you
will have lost your wager.&rdquo;&nbsp; Putting my hand into the
pocket, I felt something which I had never felt there before, and
pulling it out, perceived that it was a clumsy leathern purse,
which I found on opening contained four ten-pound notes, and
several pieces of gold.&nbsp; &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you so,
brother?&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, in the
first place, please to pay me the five shillings you have
lost.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This is only a foolish piece of
pleasantry,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you put it into my pocket
whilst you were moving about me, making faces like a distracted
person.&nbsp; Here, take your purse back.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, &ldquo;not I, indeed!
don&rsquo;t think I am such a fool.&nbsp; I have won my wager, so
pay me the five shillings, brother.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do drop
this folly,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and take your purse;&rdquo; and
I flung it on the ground.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said Mr.
Petulengro, &ldquo;you were talking of quarrelling with me just
now.&nbsp; I tell you now one thing, which is, that if you do not
take back the purse I will quarrel with you; and it shall be for
good and all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll drop your acquaintance, no longer
call you my pal, and not even say sar shan to you when I meet you
by the roadside.&nbsp; Hir mi diblis, I never will.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I saw by Jasper&rsquo;s look and tone that he was in earnest,
and, as I had really a regard for the strange being, I scarcely
knew what to do.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, be persuaded, brother,&rdquo;
said Mr. Petulengro, taking up the purse, and handing it to me;
&ldquo;be persuaded; put the purse into your pocket, and buy the
horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if I did
so, would you acknowledge the horse to be yours, and receive the
money again as soon as I should be able to repay you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would, brother, I would,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;return me the money as soon as you please, provided you
buy the horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What motive have you for
wishing me to buy that horse?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s to be sold for fifty pounds,&rdquo; said
Jasper, &ldquo;and is worth four times that sum, though, like
many a splendid bargain, he is now going a begging; buy him, and
I&rsquo;m confident that, in a little time, a grand gentleman of
your appearance may have anything he asks for him, and found a
fortune by his means.&nbsp; Moreover, brother, I want to dispose
of this fifty pounds in a safe manner.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t
take it, I shall fool it away in no time, perhaps at
card-playing, for you saw how I was cheated by those blackguard
jockeys the other day&mdash;we gyptians don&rsquo;t know how to
take care of money: our best plan when we have got a handful of
guineas is to make buttons with them; but I have plenty of golden
buttons, and don&rsquo;t wish to be troubled with more, so you
can do me no <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>greater favour than vesting the money in this
speculation, by which my mind will be relieved of considerable
care and trouble for some time at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perceiving that I still hesitated, he said: &ldquo;Perhaps,
brother, you think I did not come honestly by the money: by the
honestest manner in the world, for it is the money I earnt by
fighting in the ring: I did not steal it, brother, nor did I get
it by disposing of spavined donkeys, or glandered
ponies&mdash;nor is it, brother, the profits of my wife&rsquo;s
witchcraft and dukkerin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you had better employ it in
your traffic.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have plenty of money for my
traffic, independent of this capital,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro;
&ldquo;ay, brother, and enough besides to back the husband of my
wife&rsquo;s sister, Sylvester, against Slammocks of the Chong
gav for twenty pounds, which I am thinking of doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;after all, the horse may
have found another purchaser by this time.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not he,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;there is nobody
in this neighbourhood to purchase a horse like that, unless it be
your lordship&mdash;so take the money, brother,&rdquo; and he
thrust the purse into my hand.&nbsp; Allowing myself to be
persuaded, I kept possession of the purse.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you
satisfied now?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;By no means,
brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro, &ldquo;you will please to
pay me the five shillings which you lost to me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the fifty pounds which I found
in my pocket were not mine, but put in by yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing to do with the matter,
brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;I betted you five
shillings that you had fifty pounds in your pocket, which sum you
had: I did not say that they were your own, but merely that you
had fifty pounds; you will therefore pay me, brother, or I shall
not consider you an honourable man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not wishing to
have any dispute about such a matter, I took five shillings out
of my under pocket, and gave them to him.&nbsp; Mr. Petulengro
took the money with great glee, observing: &ldquo;These five
shillings I will take to the public-house forthwith, and spend in
drinking with four of my brethren, and doing so will give me an
opportunity of telling the landlord that I have found a customer
for his horse, and that you are the man.&nbsp; It will be as well
to secure the horse as soon as possible; for though the dook
tells me that the horse is intended for you, I have now and then
found that the dook is, like myself, somewhat given to
lying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then departed, and I remained alone in the dingle.&nbsp; I
thought at first that I had committed a great piece of folly in
consenting to purchase this horse; I might find no desirable <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>purchaser
for him, until the money in my possession should be totally
exhausted, and then I might be compelled to sell him for half the
price I had given for him, or be even glad to find a person who
would receive him at a gift; I should then remain <i>sans</i>
horse, and indebted to Mr. Petulengro.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it was
possible that I might sell the horse very advantageously, and by
so doing obtain a fund sufficient to enable me to execute some
grand enterprise or other.&nbsp; My present way of life afforded
no prospect of support, whereas the purchase of the horse did
afford a possibility of bettering my condition, so, after all,
had I not done right in consenting to purchase the horse?&nbsp;
The purchase was to be made with another person&rsquo;s property,
it is true, and I did not exactly like the idea of speculating
with another person&rsquo;s property, but Mr. Petulengro had
thrust his money upon me, and if I lost his money, he could have
no one but himself to blame; so I persuaded myself that I had,
upon the whole, done right, and having come to that persuasion, I
soon began to enjoy the idea of finding myself on horseback
again, and figured to myself all kinds of strange adventures
which I should meet with on the roads before the horse and I
should part company.</p>
<h2><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">saw</span> nothing more of Mr.
Petulengro that evening; on the morrow, however, he came and
informed me that he had secured the horse for me, and that I was
to go and pay for it at noon.&nbsp; At the hour appointed,
therefore, I went with Mr. Petulengro and Tawno to the public,
where, as before, there was a crowd of company.&nbsp; The
landlord received us in the bar with marks of much satisfaction
and esteem, made us sit down, and treated us with some excellent
mild draught ale.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who do you think has been here
this morning?&rdquo; he said to me; &ldquo;why, that fellow in
black, who came to carry me off to a house of Popish devotion,
where I was to pass seven days and nights in meditation, as I
think he called it, before I publicly renounced the religion of
my country.&nbsp; I read him a pretty lecture, calling him
several unhandsome names, and asking him what he meant by
attempting to seduce a churchwarden of the Church of
England.&nbsp; I tell you what, he ran some danger; for some of
my customers, learning his errand, laid hold on him, and were
about to toss him in a blanket, and then duck him in the
horse-pond.&nbsp; I, however, interfered, and said, &lsquo;that
what he came about was between me and him, and that it was no
business of theirs&rsquo;.&nbsp; To tell you the truth, I felt
pity for the poor devil, more especially when I considered that
they merely sided against him because they thought him the
weakest, and that they would have wanted to serve me in the same
manner had they considered me a down pin; so I rescued him from
their hands, told him not to be afraid, for that nobody should
touch him, and offered to treat him to some cold gin and water
with a lump of sugar in it; and on his refusing, told him that he
had better make himself scarce, which he did, and I hope I shall
never see him again.&nbsp; So I suppose you are come for the
horse; mercy upon us! who would have thought you would have
become the purchaser?&nbsp; The horse, however, seemed to know it
by his neighing.&nbsp; How did you ever come by the money?
however, that&rsquo;s no matter of mine.&nbsp; I suppose you are
strongly backed by certain friends you have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I informed the landlord that he was right in supposing that I
<a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>came for
the horse, but that, before I paid for him, I should wish to
prove his capabilities.&nbsp; &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo;
said the landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;You shall mount him this
moment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then going into the stable, he saddled and
bridled the horse, and presently brought him out before the
door.&nbsp; I mounted him, Mr. Petulengro putting a heavy whip
into my hand, and saying a few words to me in his own mysterious
language.&nbsp; &ldquo;The horse wants no whip,&rdquo; said the
landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hold your tongue, daddy,&rdquo; said Mr.
Petulengro.&nbsp; &ldquo;My pal knows quite well what to do with
the whip, he&rsquo;s not going to beat the horse with
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; About four hundred yards from the house there
was a hill, to the foot of which the road ran almost on a perfect
level; towards the foot of this hill, I trotted the horse, who
set off at a long, swift pace, seemingly at the rate of about
sixteen miles an hour.&nbsp; On reaching the foot of the hill, I
wheeled the animal round, and trotted him towards the
house&mdash;the horse sped faster than before.&nbsp; Ere he had
advanced a hundred yards, I took off my hat, in obedience to the
advice which Mr. Petulengro had given me, in his own language,
and holding it over the horse&rsquo;s head commenced drumming on
the crown with the knob of the whip; the horse gave a slight
start, but instantly recovering himself, continued his trot till
he arrived at the door of the public-house, amidst the
acclamations of the company, who had all rushed out of the house
to be spectators of what was going on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see now
what you wanted the whip for,&rdquo; said the landlord,
&ldquo;and sure enough, that drumming on your hat was no bad way
of learning whether the horse was quiet or not.&nbsp; Well, did
you ever see a more quiet horse, or a better
trotter?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My cob shall trot against
him,&rdquo; said a fellow, dressed in velveteen, mounted on a low
powerful-looking animal.&nbsp; &ldquo;My cob shall trot against
him to the hill and back again&mdash;come on!&rdquo;&nbsp; We
both started; the cob kept up gallantly against the horse for
about half the way to the hill, when he began to lose ground; at
the foot of the hill he was about fifteen yards behind.&nbsp;
Whereupon I turned slowly and waited for him.&nbsp; We then set
off towards the house, but now the cob had no chance, being at
least twenty yards behind when I reached the door.&nbsp; This
running of horses, the wild uncouth forms around me, and the ale
and beer which were being guzzled from pots and flagons, put me
wonderfully in mind of the ancient horse-races of the heathen
north.&nbsp; I almost imagined myself Gunnar of Hlitharend at the
race of &mdash; &mdash;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you satisfied?&rdquo; said the landlord.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you tell me that he could leap?&rdquo; I
demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am told he can,&rdquo; said the
landlord; &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t consent that he should be
tried in that <a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>way, as he might be damaged.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t trust my pal to leap that horse, he&rsquo;ll
merely fling him down, and break his neck and his own.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a better man than he close by; let him get on his
back and leap him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You mean yourself, I
suppose,&rdquo; said the landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I call that
talking modestly, and nothing becomes a young man more than
modesty.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t I,
daddy,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the
man,&rdquo; said he, pointing to Tawno.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
the horse-leaper of the world!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You mean the
horse-back breaker,&rdquo; said the landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
big fellow would break down my cousin&rsquo;s horse.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, he weighs only sixteen stone,&rdquo; said Mr.
Petulengro.&nbsp; &ldquo;And his sixteen stone, with his way of
handling a horse, does not press so much as any other one&rsquo;s
thirteen.&nbsp; Only let him get on the horse&rsquo;s back, and
you&rsquo;ll see what he can do!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
said the landlord, &ldquo;it won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Whereupon Mr. Petulengro became very much excited, and pulling
out a handful of money, said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,
I&rsquo;ll forfeit these guineas, if my black pal there does the
horse any kind of damage; duck me in the horse-pond if I
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the landlord,
&ldquo;for the sport of the thing I consent, so let your white
pal get down, and your black pal mount as soon as he
pleases.&rdquo;&nbsp; I felt rather mortified at Mr.
Petulengro&rsquo;s interference, and showed no disposition to
quit my seat; whereupon he came up to me and said: &ldquo;Now,
brother, do get out of the saddle&mdash;you are no bad hand at
trotting, I am willing to acknowledge that; but at leaping a
horse there is no one like Tawno.&nbsp; Let every dog be praised
for his own gift.&nbsp; You have been showing off in your line
for the last half-hour; now do give Tawno a chance of exhibiting
a little; poor fellow, he hasn&rsquo;t often a chance of
exhibiting, as his wife keeps him so much out of
sight.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not wishing to appear desirous of engrossing
the public attention, and feeling rather desirous to see how
Tawno, of whose exploits in leaping horses I had frequently
heard, would acquit himself in the affair, I at length
dismounted, and Tawno at a bound, leaped into the saddle, where
he really looked like Gunnar of Hlitharend, save and except the
complexion of Gunnar was florid, whereas that of Tawno was of
nearly Mulatto darkness; and that all Tawno&rsquo;s features were
cast in the Grecian model, whereas Gunnar had a snub nose.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a leaping-bar behind the house,&rdquo; said
the landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;Leaping-bar!&rdquo; said Mr.
Petulengro scornfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think my black pal
ever rides at a leaping-bar?&nbsp; No more than at a
windle-straw.&nbsp; Leap over that meadow-wall,
Tawno.&rdquo;&nbsp; Just past the house, in the direction in
which I had <a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>been trotting, was a wall about four feet high, beyond
which was a small meadow.&nbsp; Tawno rode the horse gently up to
the wall, permitted him to look over, then backed him for about
ten yards, and pressing his calves against the horse&rsquo;s
sides, he loosed the rein, and the horse launching forward, took
the leap in gallant style.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well done, man and
horse!&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro; &ldquo;now come back,
Tawno.&rdquo;&nbsp; The leap from the side of the meadow was,
however, somewhat higher; and the horse, when pushed at it, at
first turned away; whereupon Tawno backed him to a greater
distance, pushed the horse to a full gallop, giving a wild cry;
whereupon the horse again took the wall, slightly grazing one of
his legs against it.&nbsp; &ldquo;A near thing,&rdquo; said the
landlord, &ldquo;but a good leap.&nbsp; Now, no more leaping, so
long as I have control over the animal.&rdquo;&nbsp; The horse
was then led back to the stable; and the landlord, myself and
companions going into the bar, I paid down the money for the
horse.</p>
<p>Scarcely was the bargain concluded, when two or three of the
company began to envy me the possession of the horse, and forcing
their way into the bar, with much noise and clamour, said that
the horse had been sold too cheap.&nbsp; One fellow, in
particular, with a red waistcoat, the son of a wealthy farmer,
said that if he had but known that the horse had been so good a
one, he would have bought it at the first price asked for it,
which he was now willing to pay, that is to-morrow,
supposing&mdash;&ldquo;supposing your father will let you have
the money,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;which, after all,
might not be the case, but, however that may be, it is too late
now.&nbsp; I think myself the horse has been sold for too little
money, but if so, all the better for the young man, who came
forward when no other body did with his money in his hand.&nbsp;
There, take yourselves out of my bar,&rdquo; said he to the
fellows; &ldquo;and a pretty scoundrel you,&rdquo; said he to the
man of the red waistcoat, &ldquo;to say the horse has been sold
too cheap; why, it was only yesterday you said he was good for
nothing, and were passing all kinds of jokes at him.&nbsp; Take
yourself out of my bar, I say, you and all of you,&rdquo; and he
turned the fellows out.&nbsp; I then asked the landlord whether
he would permit the horse to remain in the stable for a short
time, provided I paid for his entertainment; and on his willingly
consenting, I treated my friends with ale, and then returned with
them to the encampment.</p>
<p>That evening I informed Mr. Petulengro and his party that on
the morrow I intended to mount my horse and leave that part of
the country in quest of adventures; inquiring of Jasper where, in
the event of my selling the horse advantageously, I might meet
with <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>him, and repay the money I had borrowed of him;
whereupon Mr. Petulengro informed me that in about ten weeks I
might find him at a certain place at the Chong gav.&nbsp; I then
stated that as I could not well carry with me the property which
I possessed in the dingle, which after all was of no considerable
value, I had resolved to bestow the said property, namely, the
pony, tent, tinker-tools, etc., on Ursula and her husband, partly
because they were poor, and partly on account of the great
kindness which I bore to Ursula, from whom I had, on various
occasions, experienced all manner of civility, particularly in
regard to crabbed words.&nbsp; On hearing this intelligence,
Ursula returned many thanks to her gentle brother, as she called
me, and Sylvester was so overjoyed that, casting aside his usual
phlegm, he said I was the best friend he had ever had in the
world, and in testimony of his gratitude swore that he would
permit me to give his wife a choomer in the presence of the whole
company, which offer, however, met with a very mortifying
reception, the company frowning disapprobation, Ursula protesting
against anything of the kind, and I myself showing no forwardness
to avail myself of it, having inherited from nature a
considerable fund of modesty, to which was added no slight store
acquired in the course of my Irish education.&nbsp; I passed that
night alone in the dingle in a very melancholy manner, with
little or no sleep, thinking of Isopel Berners, and in the
morning when I quitted it I shed several tears, as I reflected
that I should probably never again see the spot where I had
passed so many hours in her company.</p>
<h2><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> reaching the plain above, I
found my Romany friends breakfasting, and on being asked by Mr.
Petulengro to join them, I accepted the invitation.&nbsp; No
sooner was breakfast over than I informed Ursula and her husband
that they would find the property, which I had promised them,
below in the dingle, commending the little pony Ambrol to their
best care.&nbsp; I took leave of the whole company, which was
itself about to break up camp and to depart in the direction of
London, and made the best of my way to the public-house.&nbsp; I
had a small bundle in my hand, and was dressed in the same manner
as when I departed from London, having left my waggoner&rsquo;s
slop with the other effects in the dingle.&nbsp; On arriving at
the public-house, I informed the landlord that I was come for my
horse, inquiring, at the same time, whether he could not
accommodate me with a bridle and saddle.&nbsp; He told me that
the bridle and saddle, with which I had ridden the horse on the
preceding day, were at my service for a trifle; that he had
received them some time since in payment for a debt, and that he
had himself no use for them.&nbsp; The leathers of the bridle
were rather shabby, and the bit rusty, and the saddle was
old-fashioned; but I was happy to purchase them for seven
shillings, more especially as the landlord added a small valise,
which he said could be strapped to the saddle, and which I should
find very convenient for carrying my things in.&nbsp; I then
proceeded to the stable, told the horse we were bound on an
expedition, and giving him a feed of corn, left him to discuss
it, and returned to the bar-room to have a little farewell chat
with the landlord, and at the same time to drink with him a
farewell glass of ale.&nbsp; Whilst we were talking and drinking,
the niece came and joined us: she was a decent, sensible young
woman, who appeared to take a great interest in her uncle, whom
she regarded with a singular mixture of pride and
disapprobation&mdash;pride for the renown which he had acquired
by his feats of old, and disapprobation for his late
imprudences.&nbsp; She said that she hoped that his misfortunes
would be a warning to him to turn more to his God than he had
hitherto done, and to give up cock-fighting and other low-life
practices.&nbsp; To which the <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>landlord replied, that with respect
to cock-fighting he intended to give it up entirely, being
determined no longer to risk his capital upon birds, and with
respect to his religious duties, he should attend the church of
which he was churchwarden at least once a quarter, adding,
however, that he did not intend to become either canter or
driveller, neither of which characters would befit a publican
surrounded by such customers as he was, and that to the last day
of his life he hoped to be able to make use of his fists.&nbsp;
After a stay of about two hours I settled accounts, and having
bridled and saddled my horse, and strapped on the valise, I
mounted, shook hands with the landlord and his niece, and
departed, notwithstanding that they both entreated me to tarry
until the evening, it being then the heat of the day.</p>
<h2><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">bent</span> my course in the direction
of the north, more induced by chance than any particular motive;
all quarters of the world having about equal attractions for
me.&nbsp; I was in high spirits at finding myself once more on
horseback, and trotted gaily on, until the heat of the weather
induced me to slacken my pace, more out of pity for my horse than
because I felt any particular inconvenience from it&mdash;heat
and cold being then, and still, matters of great indifference to
me.&nbsp; What I thought of I scarcely know, save and except that
I have a glimmering recollection that I felt some desire to meet
with one of those adventures which upon the roads of England are
generally as plentiful as blackberries in autumn; and Fortune,
who has generally been ready to gratify my inclinations, provided
it cost her very little by so doing, was not slow in furnishing
me with an adventure, perhaps as characteristic of the English
roads as anything which could have happened.</p>
<p>I might have travelled about six miles amongst cross roads and
lanes, when suddenly I found myself upon a broad and very dusty
road which seemed to lead due north.&nbsp; As I wended along this
I saw a man upon a donkey riding towards me.&nbsp; The man was
commonly dressed, with a broad felt hat on his head, and a kind
of satchel on his back; he seemed to be in a mighty hurry, and
was every now and then belabouring the donkey with a
cudgel.&nbsp; The donkey, however, which was a fine large
creature of the silver-grey species, did not appear to sympathise
at all with its rider in his desire to get on, but kept its head
turned back as much as possible, moving from one side of the road
to the other, and not making much forward way.&nbsp; As I passed,
being naturally of a very polite disposition, I gave the man the
sele of the day, asking him, at the same time, why he beat the
donkey; whereupon the fellow eyeing me askance, told me to mind
my own business, with the addition of something which I need not
repeat.&nbsp; I had not proceeded a furlong before I saw seated
on the dust by the wayside, close by a heap of stones, and with
several flints before him, a respectable-looking old man, with a
straw hat and a white smock, who was weeping bitterly.</p>
<p><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>&ldquo;What are you crying for, father?&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you come to any hurt?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hurt enough,&rdquo; sobbed the old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have just been tricked out of the best ass in England by a
villain, who gave me nothing but these trash in return,&rdquo;
pointing to the stones before him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I really scarcely
understand you,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I wish you would explain
yourself more clearly.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I was riding on my ass
from market,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;when I met here a
fellow with a sack on his back, who, after staring at the ass and
me a moment or two, asked me if I would sell her.&nbsp; I told
him that I could not think of selling her, as she was very useful
to me, and though an animal, my true companion, whom I loved as
much as if she were my wife and daughter.&nbsp; I then attempted
to pass on, but the fellow stood before me, begging me to sell
her, saying that he would give me anything for her; well, seeing
that he persisted, I said at last that if I sold her, I must have
six pounds for her, and I said so to get rid of him, for I saw
that he was a shabby fellow, who had probably not six shillings
in the world; but I had better have held my tongue,&rdquo; said
the old man, crying more bitterly than before, &ldquo;for the
words were scarcely out of my mouth, when he said he would give
me what I asked, and taking the sack from his back, he pulled out
a steelyard, and going to the heap of stones there, he took up
several of them and weighed them, then flinging them down before
me, he said: &lsquo;There are six pounds, neighbour; now, get off
the ass, and hand her over to me&rsquo;.&nbsp; Well, I sat like
one dumbfoundered for a time, till at last I asked him what he
meant?&nbsp; &lsquo;What do I mean?&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you
old rascal, why, I mean to claim my purchase,&rsquo; and then he
swore so awfully, that scarcely knowing what I did I got down,
and he jumped on the animal and rode off as fast as he
could.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose he was the fellow,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;whom I just now met upon a fine grey ass, which he
was beating with a cudgel.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I daresay he
was,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;I saw him beating her as he
rode away, and I thought I should have died.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I never heard such a story,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;well, do
you mean to submit to such a piece of roguery
quietly?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo; said the old man,
&ldquo;what can I do?&nbsp; I am seventy-nine years of age; I am
bad on my feet, and dar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go after
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall I go?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;the
fellow is a thief, and any one has a right to stop
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, if you could but bring her again to
me,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;I would bless you to my dying
day; but have a care; I don&rsquo;t know but after all the law
may say that she is his lawful purchase.&nbsp; I asked six pounds
for her, and he gave me six pounds.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Six
flints, you mean,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;no, no, the law is not
quite so bad as that either; <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>I know something about her, and am
sure that she will never sanction such a quibble.&nbsp; At all
events, I&rsquo;ll ride after the fellow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon
turning the horse round, I put him to his very best trot; I rode
nearly a mile without obtaining a glimpse of the fellow, and was
becoming apprehensive that he had escaped me by turning down some
by-path, two or three of which I had passed.&nbsp; Suddenly,
however, on the road making a slight turning, I perceived him
right before me, moving at a tolerably swift pace, having by this
time probably overcome the resistance of the animal.&nbsp;
Putting my horse to a full gallop, I shouted at the top of my
voice: &ldquo;Get off that donkey, you rascal, and give her up to
me, or I&rsquo;ll ride you down&rdquo;.&nbsp; The fellow hearing
the thunder of the horse&rsquo;s hoofs behind him, drew up on one
side of the road.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; said he,
as I stopped my charger, now almost covered with sweat and foam
close beside him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you want to rob
me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;To rob you?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No! but to take from you that ass, of which you have just
robbed its owner.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have robbed no
man,&rdquo; said the fellow; &ldquo;I just now purchased it
fairly of its master, and the law will give it to me; he asked
six pounds for it, and I gave him six pounds.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Six stones, you mean, you rascal,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;get down, or my horse shall be upon you in a
moment;&rdquo; then with a motion of my reins, I caused the horse
to rear, pressing his sides with my heels as if I intended to
make him leap.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said the man,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get down and then try if I can&rsquo;t serve
you out.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then got down, and confronted me with
his cudgel; he was a horrible-looking fellow, and seemed prepared
for anything.&nbsp; Scarcely, however, had he dismounted, when
the donkey jerked the bridle out of his hand, and probably in
revenge for the usage she had received, gave him a pair of
tremendous kicks on the hip with her hinder legs, which
overturned him, and then scampered down the road the way she had
come.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pretty treatment this,&rdquo; said the fellow,
getting up without his cudgel, and holding his hand to his side;
&ldquo;I wish I may not be lamed for life&rdquo;.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And if you be,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it would merely serve
you right, you rascal, for trying to cheat a poor old man out of
his property by quibbling at words.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Rascal!&rdquo; said the fellow, &ldquo;you lie, I am no
rascal; and as for quibbling with words&mdash;suppose I
did!&nbsp; What then?&nbsp; All the first people does it!&nbsp;
The newspapers does it! the gentlefolks that calls themselves the
guides of the popular mind does it!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m no
ignoramus.&nbsp; I reads the newspapers, and knows what&rsquo;s
what.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You read them to some purpose,&rdquo;
said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, if you are lamed for life, and
unfitted for any active line&mdash;turn newspaper editor; I
should say <a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>you are perfectly qualified, and this day&rsquo;s
adventure may be the foundation of your fortune,&rdquo; thereupon
I turned round and rode off.&nbsp; The fellow followed me with a
torrent of abuse.&nbsp; &ldquo;Confound you,&rdquo; said
he&mdash;yet that was not the expression either&mdash;&ldquo;I
know you; you are one of the horse-patrol come down into the
country on leave to see your relations.&nbsp; Confound you, you
and the like of you have knocked my business on the head near
Lunnon, and I suppose we shall have you shortly in the
country.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;To the newspaper office,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;and fabricate falsehoods out of flint stones;&rdquo;
then touching the horse with my heels, I trotted off, and coming
to the place where I had seen the old man, I found him there,
risen from the ground, and embracing his ass.</p>
<p>I told him that I was travelling down the road, and said that
if his way lay in the same direction as mine he could do no
better than accompany me for some distance, lest the fellow who,
for aught I knew, might be hovering nigh, might catch him alone,
and again get his ass from him.&nbsp; After thanking me for my
offer, which he said he would accept, he got upon his ass, and we
proceeded together down the road.&nbsp; My new acquaintance said
very little of his own accord; and when I asked him a question,
answered rather incoherently.&nbsp; I heard him every now and
then say, &ldquo;Villain!&rdquo; to himself, after which he would
pat the donkey&rsquo;s neck, from which circumstance I concluded
that his mind was occupied with his late adventure.&nbsp; After
travelling about two miles, we reached a place where a drift-way
on the right led from the great road; here my companion stopped,
and on my asking whether he was going any farther, he told me
that the path to the right was the way to his home.</p>
<p>I was bidding him farewell, when he hemmed once or twice, and
said, that as he did not live far off, he hoped that I would go
with him and taste some of his mead.&nbsp; As I had never tasted
mead, of which I had frequently read in the compositions of the
Welsh bards, and, moreover, felt rather thirsty from the heat of
the day, I told him that I should have great pleasure in
attending him.&nbsp; Whereupon, turning off together, we
proceeded about half a mile, sometimes between stone walls, and
at other times hedges, till we reached a small hamlet, through
which we passed, and presently came to a very pretty cottage,
delightfully situated within a garden, surrounded by a hedge of
woodbines.&nbsp; Opening a gate at one corner of the garden he
led the way to a large shed, which stood partly behind the
cottage, which he said was his stable; thereupon he dismounted
and led his donkey into the shed, which was without stalls, but
had a long rack and manger.&nbsp; On one side <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>he tied his
donkey, after taking off her caparisons, and I followed his
example, tying my horse at the other side with a rope halter
which he gave me; he then asked me to come in and taste his mead,
but I told him that I must attend to the comfort of my horse
first, and forthwith, taking a wisp of straw, rubbed him
carefully down.&nbsp; Then taking a pailful of clear water which
stood in the shed, I allowed the horse to drink about half a
pint; and then turning to the old man, who all the time had stood
by looking at my proceedings, I asked him whether he had any
oats?&nbsp; &ldquo;I have all kinds of grain,&rdquo; he replied;
and, going out, he presently returned with two measures, one a
large and the other a small one, both filled with oats, mixed
with a few beans, and handing the large one to me for the horse,
he emptied the other before the donkey, who, before she began to
despatch it, turned her nose to her master&rsquo;s face, and
fairly kissed him.&nbsp; Having given my horse his portion, I
told the old man that I was ready to taste his mead as soon as he
pleased, whereupon he ushered me into his cottage, where, making
me sit down by a deal table in a neatly sanded kitchen, he
produced from an old-fashioned closet a bottle, holding about a
quart, and a couple of cups, which might each contain about half
a pint, then opening the bottle and filling the cups with a
brown-coloured liquor, he handed one to me, and taking a seat
opposite to me he lifted the other, nodded, and saying to me:
&ldquo;Health and welcome,&rdquo; placed it to his lips and
drank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Health and thanks,&rdquo; I replied, and being very
thirsty, emptied my cup at a draught I had scarcely done so,
however, when I half-repented.&nbsp; The mead was deliciously
sweet and mellow, but appeared strong as brandy; my eyes reeled
in my head, and my brain became slightly dizzy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mead
is a strong drink,&rdquo; said the old man, as he looked at me,
with half a smile on his countenance.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is at any
rate,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;so strong, indeed, that I would not
drink another cup for any consideration.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And
I would not ask you,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;for, if you
did, you would most probably be stupid all day, and wake next
morning with a headache.&nbsp; Mead is a good drink, but woundily
strong, especially to those who be not used to it, as I suppose
you are not.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where do you get it?&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I make it myself,&rdquo; said the old man,
&ldquo;from the honey which my bees make.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have you many bees?&rdquo; I inquired.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
great many,&rdquo; said the old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;And do you keep
them,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for the sake of making mead with
their honey?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I keep them,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;partly because I am fond of them, and partly for what they
bring me in; they make me a great deal of honey, some of which I
sell, <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>and with a little I make me some mead to warm my poor
heart with, or occasionally to treat a friend with like
yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And do you support yourself
entirely by means of your bees?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
said the old man; &ldquo;I have a little bit of ground behind my
house, which is my principal means of support.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And do you live alone?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
said he; &ldquo;with the exception of the bees and the donkey, I
live quite alone.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And have you always lived
alone?&rdquo;&nbsp; The old man emptied his cup, and his heart
being warmed with the mead, he told me his history, which was
simplicity itself.&nbsp; His father was a small yeoman, who, at
his death, had left him, his only child, the cottage, with a
small piece of ground behind it, and on this little property he
had lived ever since.&nbsp; About the age of twenty-five he had
married an industrious young woman, by whom he had one daughter,
who died before reaching years of womanhood.&nbsp; His wife,
however, had survived her daughter many years, and had been a
great comfort to him, assisting him in his rural occupations:
but, about four years before the present period, he had lost her,
since which time he had lived alone, making himself as
comfortable as he could; cultivating his ground, with the help of
a lad from the neighbouring village, attending to his bees, and
occasionally riding his donkey to market, and hearing the word of
God, which he said he was sorry he could not read, twice a week
regularly at the parish church.&nbsp; Such was the old
man&rsquo;s tale.</p>
<p>When he had finished speaking, he led me behind his house, and
showed me his little domain.&nbsp; It consisted of about two
acres in admirable cultivation; a small portion of it formed a
kitchen garden, whilst the rest was sown with four kinds of
grain, wheat, barley, peas and beans.&nbsp; The air was full of
ambrosial sweets, resembling those proceeding from an orange
grove, a place which though I had never seen at that time, I
since have.&nbsp; In the garden was the habitation of the bees, a
long box, supported upon three oaken stumps.&nbsp; It was full of
small round glass windows, and appeared to be divided into a
great many compartments, much resembling drawers placed
sideways.&nbsp; He told me that, as one compartment was filled,
the bees left it for another; so that, whenever he wanted honey,
he could procure some without injuring the insects.&nbsp; Through
the little round windows I could see several of the bees at work;
hundreds were going in and out of the doors; hundreds were
buzzing about on the flowers, the woodbines and beans.&nbsp; As I
looked around on the well-cultivated field, the garden, and the
bees, I thought I had never before seen so rural and peaceful a
scene.</p>
<p><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>When
we returned to the cottage we again sat down, and I asked the old
man whether he was not afraid to live alone.&nbsp; He told me
that he was not, for that, upon the whole, his neighbours were
very kind to him.&nbsp; I mentioned the fellow who had swindled
him of his donkey upon the road.&nbsp; &ldquo;That was no
neighbour of mine,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;and, perhaps,
I shall never see him again, or his like.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dreadful thing,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to have
no other resource, when injured, than to shed tears on the
road.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; said the old man;
&ldquo;but God saw the tears of the old, and sent a
helper.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why did you not help yourself?&rdquo;
said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Instead of getting off your ass, why did you
not punch at the fellow, or at any rate use dreadful language,
call him villain, and shout robbery?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Punch!&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;shout! what, with
these hands, and this voice&mdash;Lord, how you run on!&nbsp; I
am old, young chap, I am old!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;it is a shameful thing to cry even when
old.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You think so now,&rdquo; said the old
man, &ldquo;because you are young and strong; perhaps when you
are as old as I, you will not be ashamed to cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon the whole I was rather pleased with the old man, and much
with all about him.&nbsp; As evening drew nigh, I told him that I
must proceed on my journey; whereupon he invited me to tarry with
him during the night, telling me that he had a nice room and bed
above at my service.&nbsp; I, however, declined, and bidding him
farewell, mounted my horse and departed.&nbsp; Regaining the
road, I proceeded once more in the direction of the north; and,
after a few hours, coming to a comfortable public-house, I
stopped, and put up for the night.</p>
<h2><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">did</span> not awake till rather late
the next morning, and when I did, I felt considerable drowsiness,
with a slight headache, which I was uncharitable enough to
attribute to the mead which I had drunk on the preceding
day.&nbsp; After feeding my horse, and breakfasting, I proceeded
on my wanderings.&nbsp; Nothing occurred worthy of relating till
midday was considerably past, when I came to a pleasant valley,
between two gentle hills.&nbsp; I had dismounted, in order to
ease my horse, and was leading him along by the bridle, when, on
my right, behind a bank in which some umbrageous ashes were
growing, I heard a singular noise.&nbsp; I stopped short and
listened, and presently said to myself: &ldquo;Surely this is
snoring, perhaps that of a hedgehog&rdquo;.&nbsp; On further
consideration, however, I was convinced that the noise which I
heard, and which certainly seemed to be snoring, could not
possibly proceed from the nostrils of so small an animal, but
must rather come from those of a giant, so loud and sonorous was
it.&nbsp; About two or three yards farther was a gate, partly
open, to which I went, and peeping into the field, saw a man
lying on some rich grass, under the shade of one of the ashes; he
was snoring away at a great rate.&nbsp; Impelled by curiosity, I
fastened the bridle of my horse to the gate, and went up to the
man.&nbsp; He was a genteelly-dressed individual; rather
corpulent, with dark features, and seemingly about
forty-five.&nbsp; He lay on his back, his hat slightly over his
brow, and at his right hand lay an open book.&nbsp; So
strenuously did he snore that the wind from his nostrils
agitated, perceptibly, a fine cambric frill which he wore at his
bosom.&nbsp; I gazed upon him for some time, expecting that he
might awake; but he did not, but kept on snoring, his breast
heaving convulsively.&nbsp; At last, the noise he made became so
terrible, that I felt alarmed for his safety, imagining that a
fit might seize him, and he lose his life while fast
asleep.&nbsp; I therefore exclaimed: &ldquo;Sir, sir, awake! you
sleep overmuch&rdquo;.&nbsp; But my voice failed to rouse him,
and he continued snoring as before; whereupon I touched him
slightly with my riding wand, but failing to wake him, I touched
him again more vigorously; whereupon he opened his eyes, and,
probably imagining <a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>himself in a dream, closed them again.&nbsp; But I was
determined to arouse him, and cried as loud as I could:
&ldquo;Sir, sir, pray sleep no more!&rdquo;&nbsp; He heard what I
said, opened his eyes again, stared at me with a look of some
consciousness, and, half-raising himself upon his elbows, asked
me what was the matter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;but I took the liberty of awaking you, because you
appeared to be much disturbed in your sleep; I was fearful, too,
that you might catch a fever from sleeping under a
tree.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I run no risk,&rdquo; said the man,
&ldquo;I often come and sleep here; and as for being disturbed in
my sleep, I felt very comfortable; I wish you had not awoke
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I beg your
pardon once more.&nbsp; I assure you that what I did was with the
best intention.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! pray make no further
apology,&rdquo; said the individual; &ldquo;I make no doubt that
what you did was done kindly; but there&rsquo;s an old proverb,
to the effect, &lsquo;that you should let sleeping dogs
lie,&rsquo;&rdquo; he added with a smile.&nbsp; Then, getting up,
and stretching himself with a yawn, he took up his book and said:
&ldquo;I have slept quite long enough, and it&rsquo;s quite time
for me to be going home.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Excuse my
curiosity,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if I inquire what may induce you
to come and sleep in this meadow?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;To tell you
the truth,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;I am a bad
sleeper.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray, pardon me,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;if I tell you that I never saw one sleep more
heartily.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If I did so,&rdquo; said the
individual, &ldquo;I am beholden to this meadow and this book;
but I am talking riddles, and will explain myself.&nbsp; I am the
owner of a very pretty property, of which this valley forms
part.&nbsp; Some years ago, however, up started a person who said
the property was his; a lawsuit ensued, and I was on the brink of
losing my all, when, most unexpectedly, the suit was determined
in my favour.&nbsp; Owing, however, to the anxiety to which my
mind had been subjected for years, my nerves had become terribly
shaken; and no sooner was the trial terminated than sleep forsook
my pillow.&nbsp; I sometimes passed nights without closing an
eye; I took opiates, but they rather increased than alleviated my
malady.&nbsp; About three weeks ago a friend of mine put this
book into my hand, and advised me to take it every day to some
pleasant part of my estate, and try and read a page or two,
assuring me, if I did, that I should infallibly fall
asleep.&nbsp; I took his advice, and selecting this place, which
I considered the pleasantest part of my property, I came, and
lying down, commenced reading the book, and before finishing a
page was in a dead slumber.&nbsp; Every day since then I have
repeated the experiment, and every time with equal success.&nbsp;
I am a single man, without any children; and yesterday I made my
<a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>will, in
which, in the event of my friend&rsquo;s surviving me, I have
left him all my fortune, in gratitude for his having procured for
me the most invaluable of all blessings&mdash;sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how very
extraordinary!&nbsp; Do you think that your going to sleep is
caused by the meadow or the book?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose
by both,&rdquo; said my new acquaintance, &ldquo;acting in
co-operation.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;the magic influence does certainly not proceed from the
meadow alone; for since I have been here, I have not felt the
slightest inclination to sleep.&nbsp; Does the book consist of
prose or poetry?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It consists of
poetry,&rdquo; said the individual.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not
Byron&rsquo;s?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Byron&rsquo;s!&rdquo;
repeated the individual, with a smile of contempt; &ldquo;no, no;
there is nothing narcotic in Byron&rsquo;s poetry.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t like it.&nbsp; I used to read it, but it thrilled,
agitated and kept me awake.&nbsp; No; this is not Byron&rsquo;s
poetry, but the inimitable
&mdash;&rsquo;s&rdquo;&mdash;mentioning a name that I had never
heard till then.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you permit me to look at
it?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; he
answered, politely handing me the book.&nbsp; I took the volume,
and glanced over the contents.&nbsp; It was written in blank
verse, and appeared to abound in descriptions of scenery; there
was much mention of mountains, valleys, streams and waterfalls,
harebells and daffodils.&nbsp; These descriptions were
interspersed with dialogues, which though they proceeded from the
mouths of pedlars and rustics, were of the most edifying
description; mostly on subjects moral or metaphysical, and
couched in the most gentlemanly and unexceptionable language,
without the slightest mixture of vulgarity, coarseness or
pie-bald grammar.&nbsp; Such appeared to me to be the contents of
the book; but before I could form a very clear idea of them, I
found myself nodding, and a surprising desire to sleep coming
over me.&nbsp; Rousing myself, however, by a strong effort, I
closed the book, and, returning it to the owner, inquired of him,
&ldquo;Whether he had any motive in coming and lying down in the
meadow, besides the wish of enjoying sleep?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;indeed, I should
be very glad not to be compelled to do so, always provided I
could enjoy the blessing of sleep; for by lying down under trees,
I may possibly catch the rheumatism, or be stung by serpents;
and, moreover, in the rainy season and winter the thing will be
impossible, unless I erect a tent, which will possibly destroy
the charm.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you
need give yourself no further trouble about coming here, as I am
fully convinced that with this book in your hand, you may go to
sleep anywhere, as your friend was doubtless aware, though he
wished to interest your imagination for a time by persuading you
to lie <a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>abroad; therefore, in future, whenever you feel
disposed to sleep, try to read the book, and you will be sound
asleep in a minute, the narcotic influence lies in the book, and
not the field.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will follow your
advice,&rdquo; said the individual; &ldquo;and this very night
take it with me to bed, though I hope in time to be able to sleep
without it, my nerves being already much quieted from the
slumbers I have enjoyed in this field.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then moved
towards the gate, where we parted, he going one way and I and my
horse the other.</p>
<p>More than twenty years subsequent to this period, after much
wandering about the world, returning to my native country, I was
invited to a literary tea-party, where, the discourse turning
upon poetry, I, in order to show that I was not more ignorant
than my neighbours, began to talk about Byron, for whose writings
I really entertained considerable admiration, though I had no
particular esteem for the man himself.&nbsp; At first, I received
no answer to what I said&mdash;the company merely surveying me
with a kind of sleepy stare.&nbsp; At length a lady, about the
age of forty, with a large wart on her face, observed in a
drawling tone, &ldquo;That she had not read Byron&mdash;at least,
since her girlhood&mdash;and then only a few passages; but that
the impression on her mind was that his writings were of a highly
objectionable character.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I also read a little
of him in my boyhood,&rdquo; said a gentleman about sixty, but
who evidently, from his dress and demeanour, wished to appear
about thirty, &ldquo;but I highly disapproved of him; for
notwithstanding he was a nobleman, he is frequently very coarse,
and very fond of raising emotion.&nbsp; Now emotion is what I
dislike,&rdquo; drawling out the last syllable of the word
dislike.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is only one poet for me&mdash;the
divine &mdash;&rdquo; and then he mentioned a name which I had
only once heard, and afterwards quite forgotten, the name
mentioned by the snorer in the field.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! there is
no one like him!&rdquo; murmured some more of the company;
&ldquo;the poet of nature&mdash;of nature without its
vulgarity.&rdquo;&nbsp; I wished very much to ask these people
whether they were ever bad sleepers, and whether they had read
the poet, so called, from a desire of being set to sleep.&nbsp;
Within a few days, however, I learnt that it had of late become
very fashionable and genteel to appear half-asleep, and that one
could exhibit no better mark of superfine breeding than by
occasionally in company setting one&rsquo;s rhonchal organ in
action.&nbsp; I then ceased to wonder at the popularity, which I
found nearly universal, of &mdash;&rsquo;s poetry; for, certainly
in order to make one&rsquo;s self appear sleepy in company, or
occasionally to induce sleep, nothing could be more efficacious
than a slight prelection <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>of his poems.&nbsp; So poor Byron,
with his fire and emotion&mdash;to say nothing of his mouthings
and coxcombry&mdash;was dethroned, as I had prophesied he would
be more than twenty years before, on the day of his funeral,
though I had little idea that his humiliation, would have been
brought about by one, whose sole strength consists in setting
people to sleep.&nbsp; Well, all things are doomed to terminate
in sleep.&nbsp; Before that termination, however, I will venture
to prophesy that people will become a little more awake, snoring
and yawning be a little less in fashion, and poor Byron be once
more reinstated on his throne, though his rival will always stand
a good chance of being worshipped by those whose ruined nerves
are insensible to the narcotic powers of opium and morphine.</p>
<h2><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">continued</span> my journey, passing
through one or two villages.&nbsp; The day was exceedingly hot,
and the roads dusty.&nbsp; In order to cause my horse as little
fatigue as possible, and not to chafe his back, I led him by the
bridle, my doing which brought upon me a shower of remarks, jests
and would-be witticisms from the drivers and front outside
passengers of sundry stage-coaches which passed me in one
direction or the other.&nbsp; In this way I proceeded till
considerably past noon, when I felt myself very fatigued, and my
horse appeared no less so; and it is probable that the lazy and
listless manner in which we were moving on, tired us both much
more effectually than hurrying along at a swift trot would have
done, for I have observed that when the energies of the body are
not exerted a languor frequently comes over it.&nbsp; At length
arriving at a very large building with an archway, near the
entrance of a town, I sat down on what appeared to be a
stepping-block, and presently experienced a great depression of
spirits.&nbsp; I began to ask myself whither I was going, and
what I should do with myself and the horse which I held by the
bridle?&nbsp; It appeared to me that I was alone in the world
with the poor animal, who looked for support to me, who knew not
how to support myself.&nbsp; Then the image of Isopel Berners
came into my mind, and when I thought how I had lost her for
ever, and how happy I might have been with her in the New World
had she not deserted me, I became yet more miserable.</p>

<p>As I sat in this state of mind, I suddenly felt some one clap
me on the shoulder, and heard a voice say: &ldquo;Ha! comrade of
the dingle, what chance has brought you into these
parts?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I turned round, and beheld a man in
the dress of a postillion, whom I instantly recognised as he to
whom I had rendered assistance on the night of the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is it you?&nbsp; I am glad to
see you, for I was feeling very lonely and melancholy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lonely and melancholy,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;how is
that? how can any one be lonely and melancholy with such a noble
horse as that you hold by the bridle?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>&ldquo;The horse,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is one cause of
my melancholy, for I know not in the world what to do with
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it your own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I may call it my own, though
I borrowed the money to purchase it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you sell it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not always easy to find a purchaser for a horse
like this,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;can you recommend me
one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&nbsp; Why no, not exactly; but you&rsquo;ll find a
purchaser shortly&mdash;pooh! if you have no other cause for
disquiet than that horse, cheer up, man, don&rsquo;t be cast
down.&nbsp; Have you nothing else on your mind?&nbsp; By-the-bye,
what&rsquo;s become of the young woman you were keeping company
with in that queer lodging place of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has left me,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You quarrelled, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we did not exactly quarrel,
but we are parted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;but you will soon come
together again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we are parted for
ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For ever!&nbsp; Pooh! you little know how people
sometimes come together again who think they are parted for
ever.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s something on that point relating to
myself.&nbsp; You remember, when I told you my story in that
dingle of yours, that I mentioned a young woman, my
fellow-servant when I lived with the English family in Mumbo
Jumbo&rsquo;s town, and how she and I, when our foolish governors
were thinking of changing their religion, agreed to stand by each
other, and be true to old Church of England, and to give our
governors warning, provided they tried to make us
renegades.&nbsp; Well, she and I parted soon after that, and
never thought to meet again, yet we met the other day in the
fields, for she lately came to live with a great family not far
from here, and we have since agreed to marry, to take a little
farm, for we have both a trifle of money, and live together till
&lsquo;death us do part&rsquo;.&nbsp; So much for parting for
ever!&nbsp; But what do I mean by keeping you broiling in the sun
with your horse&rsquo;s bridle in your hand, and you on my own
ground?&nbsp; Do you know where you are?&nbsp; Why, that great
house is my inn, that is, it&rsquo;s my master&rsquo;s, the best
fellow in &mdash;.&nbsp; Come along, you and your horse, both
will find a welcome at my inn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon he led the way into a large court in which there
were coaches, chaises, and a great many people; taking my horse
from me, he led it into a nice cool stall, and fastened it to the
rack; he <a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>then conducted me into a postillion&rsquo;s
keeping-room, which at that time chanced to be empty, and he then
fetched a pot of beer and sat down by me.</p>
<p>After a little conversation he asked me what I intended to do,
and I told him frankly that I did not know; whereupon he observed
that, provided I had no objection, he had little doubt that I
could be accommodated for some time at his inn.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our
upper ostler,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;died about a week ago; he
was a clever fellow, and, besides his trade, understood reading
and accounts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said I, interrupting him, &ldquo;I am
not fitted for the place of ostler; moreover, I refused the place
of ostler at a public-house, which was offered to me only a few
days ago.&rdquo;&nbsp; The postillion burst into a laugh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ostler at a public-house, indeed! why, you would not
compare a berth at a place like that with the situation of ostler
at my inn, the first road-house in England!&nbsp; However, I was
not thinking of the place of ostler for you; you are, as you say,
not fitted for it, at any rate, not at a house like this.&nbsp;
We have, moreover, the best under-ostler in all England&mdash;old
Bill, with the drawback that he is rather fond of drink.&nbsp; We
could make shift with him very well, provided we could fall in
with a man of writing and figures, who could give an account of
the hay and corn which comes in and goes out, and wouldn&rsquo;t
object to give a look occasionally at the yard.&nbsp; Now it
appears to me that you are just such a kind of man, and, if you
will allow me to speak to the governor, I don&rsquo;t doubt that
he will gladly take you, as he feels kindly disposed towards you
from what he has heard me say concerning you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what should I do with my horse?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horse need give you no uneasiness,&rdquo; said the
postillion; &ldquo;I know he will be welcome here both for bed
and manger, and, perhaps, in a little time you may find a
purchaser, as a vast number of sporting people frequent this
house.&rdquo;&nbsp; I offered two or three more objections, which
the postillion overcame with great force of argument, and the pot
being nearly empty, he drained it to the bottom drop, and then
starting up, left me alone.</p>
<p>In about twenty minutes he returned, accompanied by a highly
intelligent-looking individual, dressed in blue and black, with a
particularly white cravat, and without a hat on his head: this
individual, whom I should have mistaken for a gentleman but for
the intelligence depicted in his face, he introduced to me as the
master of the inn.&nbsp; The master of the inn shook me warmly by
the hand, told me that he was happy to see me in his house, and
thanked me in the handsomest terms for the kindness I had <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>shown to
his servant in the affair of the thunderstorm.&nbsp; Then saying
that he was informed I was out of employ, he assured me that he
should be most happy to engage me to keep his hay and corn
account, and as general superintendent of the yard, and that with
respect to the horse, which he was told I had, he begged to
inform me that I was perfectly at liberty to keep it at the inn
upon the very best, until I could find a purchaser; that with
regard to wages&mdash;but he had no sooner mentioned wages than I
cut him short, saying, that provided I stayed I should be most
happy to serve him for bed and board, and requested that he would
allow me until the next morning to consider of his offer; he
willingly consented to my request, and, begging that I would call
for anything I pleased, left me alone with the postillion.</p>
<p>I passed that night until about ten o&rsquo;clock with the
postillion, when he left me, having to drive a family about ten
miles across the country; before his departure, however, I told
him that I had determined to accept the offer of his governor, as
he called him.&nbsp; At the bottom of my heart I was most happy
that an offer had been made, which secured to myself and the
animal a comfortable retreat at a moment when I knew not whither
in the world to take myself and him.</p>
<h2><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> inn, of which I had become an
inhabitant, was a place of infinite life and bustle.&nbsp;
Travellers of all descriptions, from all the cardinal points,
were continually stopping at it; and to attend to their wants,
and minister to their convenience, an army of servants, of one
description or other, was kept; waiters, chambermaids, grooms,
postillions, shoe-blacks, cooks, scullions, and what not, for
there was a barber and hair-dresser, who had been at Paris, and
talked French with a cockney accent, the French sounding all the
better, as no accent is so melodious as the cockney.&nbsp; Jacks
creaked in the kitchens turning round spits, on which large
joints of meat piped and smoked before the great big fires.&nbsp;
There was running up and down stairs, and along galleries,
slamming of doors, cries of &ldquo;Coming, sir,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Please to step this way, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; during
eighteen hours of the four-and-twenty.&nbsp; Truly a very great
place for life and bustle was this inn.&nbsp; And often in after
life, when lonely and melancholy, I have called up the time I
spent there, and never failed to become cheerful from the
recollection.</p>
<p>I found the master of the house a very kind and civil
person.&nbsp; Before being an innkeeper he had been in some other
line of business; but on the death of the former proprietor of
the inn had married his widow, who was still alive, but, being
somewhat infirm, lived in a retired part of the house.&nbsp; I
have said that he was kind and civil; he was, however, not one of
those people who suffer themselves to be made fools of by
anybody; he knew his customers, and had a calm, clear eye, which
would look through a man without seeming to do so.&nbsp; The
accommodation of his house was of the very best description; his
wines were good, his viands equally so, and his charges not
immoderate; though he very properly took care of himself.&nbsp;
He was no vulgar innkeeper, had a host of friends, and deserved
them all.&nbsp; During the time I lived with him, he was
presented by a large assemblage of his friends and customers with
a dinner at his own house, which was very costly, and at which
the best of wines were sported, and after the dinner with a piece
of plate estimated at fifty guineas.&nbsp; <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>He received
the plate, made a neat speech of thanks, and when the bill was
called for, made another neat speech, in which he refused to
receive one farthing for the entertainment, ordering in at the
same time two dozen more of the best champagne, and sitting down
amidst uproarious applause, and cries of &ldquo;You shall be no
loser by it!&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing very wonderful in such conduct,
some people will say; I don&rsquo;t say there is, nor have I any
intention to endeavour to persuade the reader that the landlord
was a Carlo Borromeo; he merely gave a <i>quid pro quo</i>; but
it is not every person who will give you a <i>quid pro
quo</i>.&nbsp; Had he been a vulgar publican, he would have sent
in a swinging bill after receiving the plate; &ldquo;but then no
vulgar publican would have been presented with plate&rdquo;;
perhaps not, but many a vulgar public character has been
presented with plate, whose admirers never received a <i>quid pro
quo</i>, except in the shape of a swinging bill.</p>
<p>I found my duties of distributing hay and corn, and keeping an
account thereof, anything but disagreeable, particularly after I
had acquired the good-will of the old ostler, who at first looked
upon me with rather an evil eye, considering me somewhat in the
light of one who had usurped an office which belonged to himself
by the right of succession; but there was little gall in the old
fellow, and, by speaking kindly to him, never giving myself any
airs of assumption, but, above all, by frequently reading the
newspapers to him&mdash;for though passionately fond of news and
politics, he was unable to read&mdash;I soon succeeded in placing
myself on excellent terms with him.&nbsp; A regular character was
that old ostler; he was a Yorkshireman by birth, but had seen a
great deal of life in the vicinity of London, to which, on the
death of his parents, who were very poor people, he went at a
very early age.&nbsp; Amongst other places where he had served as
ostler was a small inn at Hounslow, much frequented by
highwaymen, whose exploits he was fond of narrating, especially
those of Jerry Abershaw, who, he said, was a capital rider; and
on hearing his accounts of that worthy, I half regretted that the
old fellow had not been in London, and I had not formed his
acquaintance about the time I was thinking of writing the life of
the said Abershaw, not doubting that with his assistance, I could
have produced a book at least as remarkable as the life and
adventures of that entirely imaginary personage Joseph Sell;
perhaps, however, I was mistaken; and whenever Abershaw&rsquo;s
life shall appear before the public&mdash;and my publisher
credibly informs me that it has not yet appeared&mdash;I beg and
entreat the public to state which it likes best, the life of
Abershaw or that of Sell, for which latter <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>work I am
informed that during the last few months there has been a
prodigious demand.&nbsp; My old friend, however, after talking of
Abershaw, would frequently add, that, good rider as Abershaw
certainly was, he was decidedly inferior to Richard Ferguson,
generally called Galloping Dick, who was a pal of
Abershaw&rsquo;s, and had enjoyed a career as long, and nearly as
remarkable as his own.&nbsp; I learned from him that both were
capital customers at the Hounslow inn, and that he had frequently
drank with them in the corn-room.&nbsp; He said that no man could
desire more jolly or entertaining companions over a glass of
&ldquo;summut,&rdquo; but that upon the road it was anything but
desirable to meet them; there they were terrible, cursing and
swearing, and thrusting the muzzles of their pistols into
people&rsquo;s mouths; and at this part of his locution the old
man winked, and said, in a somewhat lower voice, that upon the
whole they were right in doing so, and that when a person had
once made up his mind to become a highwayman, his best policy was
to go the whole hog, fearing nothing, but making everybody afraid
of him; that people never thought of resisting a savage-faced,
foul-mouthed highwayman, and if he were taken, were afraid to
bear witness against him, lest he should get off and cut their
throats some time or other upon the roads; whereas people would
resist being robbed by a sneaking, pale-visaged rascal, and would
swear bodily against him on the first opportunity, adding, that
Abershaw and Ferguson, two most awful fellows, had enjoyed a long
career, whereas two disbanded officers of the army, who wished to
rob a coach like gentlemen, had begged the passengers&rsquo;
pardon, and talked of hard necessity, had been set upon by the
passengers themselves, amongst whom were three women, pulled from
their horses, conducted to Maidstone, and hanged with as little
pity as such contemptible fellows deserved.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is
nothing like going the whole hog,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;and
if ever I had been a highwayman, I would have done so; I should
have thought myself all the more safe; and, moreover,
shouldn&rsquo;t have despised myself.&nbsp; To curry favour with
those you are robbing, sometimes at the expense of your own
comrades, as I have known fellows do, why, it is the
greatest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; interposed my friend the postillion,
who chanced to be present at a considerable part of the old
ostler&rsquo;s discourse; &ldquo;it is, as you say, the greatest
of humbug, and merely, after all, gets a fellow into trouble; but
no regular bred highwayman would do it.&nbsp; I say, George,
catch the Pope of Rome trying to curry favour with anybody he
robs; catch old Mumbo Jumbo currying favour with the Archbishop
of Canterbury and the Dean and <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>Chapter, should he meet them in a
stage-coach; it would be with him, <i>Bricconi abbasso</i>, as he
knocked their teeth out with the butt of his trombone; and the
old regular-built ruffian would be all the safer for it, as Bill
would say, as ten to one the Archbishop and Chapter, after such a
spice of his quality, would be afraid to swear against him, and
to hang him, even if he were in their power, though that would be
the proper way; for, if it is the greatest of all humbug for a
highwayman to curry favour with those he robs, the next greatest
is to try to curry favour with a highwayman when you have got
him, by letting him off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finding the old man so well acquainted with the history of
highwaymen, and taking considerable interest in the subject,
having myself edited a book containing the lives of many
remarkable people who had figured on the highway, I forthwith
asked him how it was that the trade of highwaymen had become
extinct in England, as at present we never heard of any one
following it.&nbsp; Whereupon he told me that many causes had
contributed to bring about that result; the principal of which
were the following: the refusal to license houses which were
known to afford shelter to highwaymen, which, amongst many
others, had caused the inn at Hounslow to be closed; the
inclosure of many a wild heath in the country, on which they were
in the habit of lurking, and particularly the establishing in the
neighbourhood of London of a well-armed mounted patrol, who rode
the highwaymen down, and delivered them up to justice, which
hanged them without ceremony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that would be the way to deal with Mumbo Jumbo and
his gang,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;should they show
their visages in these realms; and I hear by the newspapers that
they are becoming every day more desperate.&nbsp; Take away the
licence from their public-houses, cut down the rookeries and
shadowy old avenues in which they are fond of lying in wait, in
order to sally out upon people as they pass in the roads; but,
above all, establish a good mounted police to ride after the
ruffians and drag them by the scruff of the neck to the next
clink, where they might lie till they could be properly dealt
with by law; instead of which, the Government are repealing the
wise old laws enacted against such characters, giving fresh
licenses every day to their public-houses, and saying that it
would be a pity to cut down their rookeries and thickets because
they look so very picturesque; and, in fact, giving them all kind
of encouragement; why, if such behaviour is not enough to drive
an honest man mad, I know not what is.&nbsp; It is of no use
talking; I only wish the power were in my hands, and if <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>I did not
make short work of them, might I be a mere jackass postillion all
the remainder of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides acquiring from the ancient ostler a great deal of
curious information respecting the ways and habits of the heroes
of the road, with whom he had come in contact in the early
portion of his life, I picked up from him many excellent hints
relating to the art of grooming horses.&nbsp; Whilst at the inn,
I frequently groomed the stage and post-horses, and those driven
up by travellers in their gigs: I was not compelled, nor indeed
expected, to do so, but I took pleasure in the occupation; and I
remember at that period one of the principal objects of my
ambition was to be a first-rate groom, and to make the skins of
the creatures I took in hand look sleek and glossy like those of
moles.&nbsp; I have said that I derived valuable hints from the
old man, and, indeed, became a very tolerable groom, but there
was a certain finishing touch which I could never learn from him,
though he possessed it himself, and which I could never attain to
by my own endeavours; though my want of success certainly did not
proceed from want of application, for I have rubbed the horses
down, purring and buzzing all the time, after the genuine ostler
fashion, until the perspiration fell in heavy drops upon my
shoes, and when I had done my best and asked the old fellow what
he thought of my work, I could never extract from him more than a
kind of grunt, which might be translated, &ldquo;Not so very bad,
but I have seen a horse groomed much better,&rdquo; which leads
me to suppose that a person, in order to be a first-rate groom,
must have something in him when he is born which I had not, and,
indeed, which many other people have not who pretend to be
grooms.&nbsp; What does the reader think?</p>
<h2><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> one thing I am certain, that the
reader must be much delighted with the wholesome smell of the
stable, with which many of these pages are redolent; what a
contrast to the sickly odours exhaled from those of some of my
contemporaries, especially of those who pretend to be of the
highly fashionable class, and who treat of reception-rooms, well
may they be styled so, in which dukes, duchesses, earls,
countesses, archbishops, bishops, mayors, mayoresses&mdash;not
forgetting the writers themselves, both male and
female&mdash;congregate and press upon one another; how cheering,
how refreshing, after having been nearly knocked down with such
an atmosphere, to come in contact with genuine stable
hartshorn.&nbsp; Oh! the reader shall have yet more of the
stable, and of that old ostler, for which he or she will
doubtless exclaim, &ldquo;Much obliged!&rdquo;&mdash;and, lest I
should forget to perform my promise, the reader shall have it
now.</p>
<p>I shall never forget an harangue from the mouth of the old
man, which I listened to one warm evening as he and I sat on the
threshold of the stable, after having attended to some of the
wants of a batch of coach-horses.&nbsp; It related to the manner
in which a gentleman should take care of his horse and self,
whilst engaged in a journey on horseback, and was addressed to
myself, on the supposition of my one day coming to an estate, and
of course becoming a gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you are a gentleman,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;should
you ever wish to take a journey on a horse of your own, and you
could not have a much better than the one you have here eating
its fill in the box yonder&mdash;I wonder, by-the-bye, how you
ever came by it&mdash;you can&rsquo;t do better than follow the
advice I am about to give you, both with respect to your animal
and yourself.&nbsp; Before you start, merely give your horse a
couple of handfuls of corn and a little water, somewhat under a
quart, and if you drink a pint of water yourself out of the pail,
you will feel all the better during the whole day; then you may
walk and trot your animal for about ten miles, till you come to
some nice inn, where you may get down and see your horse led into
a nice stall, telling the ostler not to feed <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>him till
you come.&nbsp; If the ostler happens to be a dog-fancier, and
has an English terrier dog like that of mine there, say what a
nice dog it is, and praise its black and tawn; and if he does not
happen to be a dog-fancier, ask him how he&rsquo;s getting on,
and whether he ever knew worse times; that kind of thing will
please the ostler, and he will let you do just what you please
with your own horse, and when your back is turned, he&rsquo;ll
say to his comrades what a nice gentleman you are, and how he
thinks he has seen you before; then go and sit down to breakfast,
and, before you have finished breakfast, get up and go and give
your horse a feed of corn; chat with the ostler two or three
minutes, till your horse has taken the shine out of his corn,
which will prevent the ostler taking any of it away when your
back is turned, for such things are sometimes done&mdash;not that
I ever did such a thing myself when I was at the inn at
Hounslow.&nbsp; Oh, dear me, no!&nbsp; Then go and finish your
breakfast, and when you have finished your breakfast and called
for the newspaper, go and water your horse, letting him have one
pailful, then give him another feed of corn, and enter into
discourse with the ostler about bull-baiting, the prime minister,
and the like; and when your horse has once more taken the shine
out of his corn, go back to your room and your newspaper, and I
hope for your sake it may be the <i>Globe</i>, for that&rsquo;s
the best paper going, then pull the bell-rope and order in your
bill, which you will pay without counting it up, supposing you to
be a gentleman.&nbsp; Give the waiter sixpence, and order out
your horse, and when your horse is out, pay for the corn, and
give the ostler a shilling, then mount your horse and walk him
gently for five miles; and whilst you are walking him in this
manner, it may be as well to tell you to take care that you do
not let him down and smash his knees, more especially if the road
be a particularly good one, for it is not at a desperate hiverman
pace, and over very bad roads, that a horse tumbles and smashes
his knees, but on your particularly nice road, when the horse is
going gently and lazily, and is half asleep, like the gemman on
his back; well, at the end of the five miles, when the horse has
digested his food, and is all right, you may begin to push your
horse on, trotting him a mile at a heat, and then walking him a
quarter of a one, that his wind may be not distressed; and you
may go on in that way for thirty miles, never galloping, of
course, for none but fools or hivermen ever gallop horses on
roads; and at the end of that distance you may stop at some other
nice inn to dinner.&nbsp; I say, when your horse is led into the
stable, after that same thirty miles&rsquo; trotting and walking,
don&rsquo;t let the saddle be whisked off at once, for if you do
your horse will <a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>have such a sore back as will frighten you, but let
your saddle remain on your horse&rsquo;s back, with the girths
loosened, till after his next feed of corn, and be sure that he
has no corn, much less water, till after a long hour and more;
after he is fed he may be watered to the tune of half a pail, and
then the ostler can give him a regular rub down; you may then sit
down to dinner, and when you have dined get up and see to your
horse as you did after breakfast, in fact, you must do much after
the same fashion you did at t&rsquo;other inn; see to your horse,
and by no means disoblige the ostler.&nbsp; So when you have seen
to your horse a second time, you will sit down to your bottle of
wine&mdash;supposing you to be a gentleman&mdash;and after you
have finished it, and your argument about the corn-laws, with any
commercial gentleman who happens to be in the room, you may mount
your horse again, not forgetting to do the proper thing to the
waiter and ostler; you may mount your horse again and ride him,
as you did before, for about five and twenty miles, at the end of
which you may put up for the night after a very fair day&rsquo;s
journey, for no gentleman, supposing he weighs sixteen stone, as
I suppose you will by the time you become a gentleman, ought to
ride a horse more than sixty-five miles in one day, provided he
has any regard for his horse&rsquo;s back, or his own
either.&nbsp; See to your horse at night, and have him well
rubbed down.&nbsp; The next day you may ride your horse forty
miles, just as you please, but never foolishly, and those forty
miles will bring you to your journey&rsquo;s end, unless your
journey be a plaguy long one, and if so, never ride your horse
more than five and thirty miles a day, always, however, seeing
him well fed, and taking more care of him than yourself; which is
but right and reasonable, seeing as how the horse is the best
animal of the two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you are a gentleman,&rdquo; said he, after a
pause, &ldquo;the first thing you must think about is to provide
yourself with a good horse for your own particular riding; you
will perhaps keep a coach and pair, but they will be less your
own than your lady&rsquo;s, should you have one, and your young
gentry, should you have any; or, if you have neither, for madam,
your housekeeper, and the upper female servants; so you need
trouble your head less about them, though, of course, you would
not like to pay away your money for screws; but be sure you get a
good horse for your own riding; and that you may have a good
chance of having a good one, buy one that&rsquo;s young and has
plenty of belly&mdash;a little more than the one has which you
now have, though you are not yet a gentleman; you will, of
course, look to his head, his withers, legs and other points, but
never buy a horse at any price that has <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>not plenty
of belly; no horse that has not belly is ever a good feeder, and
a horse that a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a good feeder, can&rsquo;t be a
good horse; never buy a horse that is drawn up in the belly
behind; a horse of that description can&rsquo;t feed, and can
never carry sixteen stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So when you have got such a horse be proud of
it&mdash;as I daresay you are of the one you have now&mdash;and
wherever you go swear there a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t another to match it
in the country, and if anybody gives you the lie, take him by the
nose and tweak it off, just as you would do if anybody were to
speak ill of your lady, or, for want of her, of your
housekeeper.&nbsp; Take care of your horse, as you would of the
apple of your eye&mdash;I am sure I would if I were a gentleman,
which I don&rsquo;t ever expect to be, and hardly wish, seeing as
how I am sixty-nine, and am rather too old to ride&mdash;yes,
cherish and take care of your horse as perhaps the best friend
you have in the world; for, after all, who will carry you through
thick and thin as your horse will? not your gentlemen friends, I
warrant, nor your housekeeper, nor your upper servants, male or
female; perhaps your lady would, that is, if she is a whopper,
and one of the right sort; the others would be more likely to
take up mud and pelt you with it, provided they saw you in
trouble, than to help you.&nbsp; So take care of your horse, and
feed him every day with your own hands; give him three-quarters
of a peck of corn each day, mixed up with a little hay-chaff, and
allow him besides one hundredweight of hay in the course of a
week; some say that the hay should be hardland hay, because it is
wholesomest, but I say, let it be clover hay, because the horse
likes it best; give him through summer and winter, once a week, a
pailful of bran mash, cold in summer and in winter hot; ride him
gently about the neighbourhood every day, by which means you will
give exercise to yourself and horse, and, moreover, have the
satisfaction of exhibiting yourself and your horse to advantage,
and hearing, perhaps, the men say what a fine horse, and the
ladies saying what a fine man: never let your groom mount your
horse, as it is ten to one, if you do, your groom will be wishing
to show off before company, and will fling your horse down.&nbsp;
I was groom to a gemman before I went to the inn at Hounslow, and
flung him a horse down worth ninety guineas, by endeavouring to
show off before some ladies that I met on the road.&nbsp; Turn
your horse out to grass throughout May and the first part of
June, for then the grass is sweetest, and the flies don&rsquo;t
sting so bad as they do later in summer; afterwards merely turn
him out occasionally in the swale of the morn and the evening;
after September the grass is good for <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>little, lash and sour at best; every
horse should go out to grass, if not his blood becomes full of
greasy humours, and his wind is apt to become affected, but he
ought to be kept as much as possible from the heat and flies,
always got up at night, and never turned out late in the
year&mdash;Lord! if I had always such a nice attentive person to
listen to me as you are, I could go on talking about &rsquo;orses
to the end of time.&rdquo;</p>

150</span>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">lived</span> on very good terms, not
only with the master and the old ostler, but with all the
domestics and hangers on at the inn, waiters, chambermaids, cooks
and scullions, not forgetting the &ldquo;boots,&rdquo; of which
there were three.&nbsp; As for the postillions, I was sworn
brother with them all, and some of them went so far as to swear
that I was the best fellow in the world; for which high opinion
entertained by them of me, I believe I was principally indebted
to the good account their comrade gave of me, whom I had so
hospitably received in the dingle.&nbsp; I repeat that I lived on
good terms with all the people connected with the inn, and was
noticed and spoken kindly to by some of the
guests&mdash;especially by that class termed commercial
travellers&mdash;all of whom were great friends and patronisers
of the landlord, and were the principal promoters of the dinner,
and subscribers to the gift of plate, which I have already spoken
of, the whole fraternity striking me as the jolliest set of
fellows imaginable, the best customers to an inn, and the most
liberal to servants; there was one description of persons,
however, frequenting the inn, which I did not like at all, and
which I did not get on well with, and these people were the
stage-coachmen.</p>
<p>The stage-coachmen of England, at the time of which I am
speaking, considered themselves mighty fine gentry, nay, I verily
believe the most important personages of the realm, and their
entertaining this high opinion of themselves can scarcely be
wondered at; they were low fellows, but masters at driving;
driving was in fashion, and sprigs of nobility used to dress as
coachmen and imitate the slang and behaviour of coachmen, from
whom occasionally they would take lessons in driving as they sat
beside them on the box, which post of honour any sprig of
nobility who happened to take a place on a coach claimed as his
unquestionable right; and then these sprigs would smoke cigars
and drink sherry with the coachmen in bar-rooms, and on the road;
and, when bidding them farewell, would give them a guinea or a
half-guinea, and shake them by the hand, so that these fellows,
being low fellows, very naturally thought no small liquor of
themselves, <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>but would talk familiarly of their friends lords so and
so, the honourable misters so and so, and Sir Harry and Sir
Charles, and be wonderfully saucy to any one who was not a lord,
or something of the kind; and this high opinion of themselves
received daily augmentation from the servile homage paid them by
the generality of the untitled male passengers, especially those
on the fore part of the coach, who used to contend for the honour
of sitting on the box with the coachman when no sprig was nigh to
put in his claim.&nbsp; Oh! what servile homage these craven
creatures did pay these same coach fellows, more especially after
witnessing this or t&rsquo;other act of brutality practised upon
the weak and unoffending&mdash;upon some poor friendless woman
travelling with but little money, and perhaps a brace of hungry
children with her, or upon some thin and half-starved man
travelling on the hind part of the coach from London to Liverpool
with only eighteen pence in his pocket after his fare was paid,
to defray his expenses on the road; for as the insolence of these
knights was vast, so was their rapacity enormous; they had been
so long accustomed to have crowns and half-crowns rained upon
them by their admirers and flatterers, that they would look at a
shilling, for which many an honest labourer was happy to toil for
ten hours under a broiling sun, with the utmost contempt; would
blow upon it derisively, or fillip it into the air before they
pocketed it; but when nothing was given them, as would
occasionally happen&mdash;for how could they receive from those
who had nothing? and nobody was bound to give them anything, as
they had certain wages from their employers&mdash;then what a
scene would ensue!&nbsp; Truly the brutality and rapacious
insolence of English coachmen had reached a climax; it was time
that these fellows should be disenchanted, and the
time&mdash;thank Heaven!&mdash;was not far distant.&nbsp; Let the
craven dastards who used to curry favour with them, and applaud
their brutality, lament their loss now that they and their
vehicles have disappeared from the roads; I, who have ever been
an enemy to insolence, cruelty and tyranny, loathe their memory,
and, what is more, am not afraid to say so, well aware of the
storm of vituperation, partly learnt from them, which I may
expect from those who used to fall down and worship them.</p>
<p>Amongst the coachmen who frequented the inn was one who was
called &ldquo;the bang-up coachman&rdquo;.&nbsp; He drove to our
inn, in the fore part of every day, one of what were called the
fast coaches, and afterwards took back the corresponding
vehicle.&nbsp; He stayed at our house about twenty minutes,
during which time the passengers of the coach which he was to
return with dined; those <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>at least who were inclined for
dinner, and could pay for it.&nbsp; He derived his sobriquet of
&ldquo;the bang-up coachman&rdquo; partly from his being dressed
in the extremity of coach dandyism, and partly from the peculiar
insolence of his manner, and the unmerciful fashion in which he
was in the habit of lashing on the poor horses committed to his
charge.&nbsp; He was a large, tall fellow, of about thirty, with
a face which, had it not been bloated by excess, and insolence
and cruelty stamped most visibly upon it, might have been called
good-looking.&nbsp; His insolence indeed was so great, that he
was hated by all the minor fry connected with coaches along the
road upon which he drove, especially the ostlers, whom he was
continually abusing or finding fault with.&nbsp; Many was the
hearty curse which he received when his back was turned; but the
generality of people were much afraid of him, for he was a
swinging, strong fellow, and had the reputation of being a
fighter, and in one or two instances had beaten in a barbarous
manner individuals who had quarrelled with him.</p>
<p>I was nearly having a fracas with this worthy.&nbsp; One day,
after he had been drinking sherry with a sprig, he swaggered into
the yard where I happened to be standing; just then a waiter came
by carrying upon a tray part of a splendid Cheshire cheese, with
a knife, plate and napkin.&nbsp; Stopping the waiter, the
coachman cut with the knife a tolerably large lump out of the
very middle of the cheese, stuck it on the end of the knife, and
putting it to his mouth nibbled a slight piece off it, and then,
tossing the rest away with disdain, flung the knife down upon the
tray, motioning the waiter to proceed; &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;you may not want before you die what you have just
flung away,&rdquo; whereupon the fellow turned furiously towards
me; just then, however, his coach being standing at the door,
there was a cry for coachman, so that he was forced to depart,
contenting himself for the present with shaking his fist at me,
and threatening to serve me out on the first opportunity; before,
however, the opportunity occurred he himself got served out in a
most unexpected manner.</p>
<p>The day after this incident he drove his coach to the inn, and
after having dismounted and received the contributions of the
generality of the passengers, he strutted up, with a cigar in his
mouth, to an individual who had come with him, and who had just
asked me a question with respect to the direction of a village
about three miles off, to which he was going.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Remember the coachman,&rdquo; said the knight of the box
to this individual, who was a thin person of about sixty, with a
white hat, rather shabby black coat, and buff-coloured trousers,
and who held an umbrella, and <a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>a small bundle in his hand.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If you expect me to give you anything,&rdquo; said he to
the coachman, &ldquo;you are mistaken; I will give you
nothing.&nbsp; You have been very insolent to me as I rode behind
you on the coach, and have encouraged two or three trumpery
fellows, who rode along with you, to cut scurvy jokes at my
expense, and now you come to me for money; I am not so poor but I
could have given you a shilling had you been civil; as it is, I
will give you nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! you won&rsquo;t,
won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said the coachman; &ldquo;dear me!&nbsp;
I hope I shan&rsquo;t starve because you won&rsquo;t give me
anything&mdash;a shilling! why, I could afford to give you twenty
if I thought fit, you pauper! civil to you, indeed! things are
come to a fine pass if I need be civil to you!&nbsp; Do you know
who you are speaking to? why, the best lords in the country are
proud to speak to me.&nbsp; Why, it was only the other day that
the Marquis of &mdash; said to me &mdash;&rdquo; and then he went
on to say what the Marquis said to him; after which, flinging
down his cigar, he strutted up the road, swearing to himself
about paupers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say it is three miles to &mdash;,&rdquo; said the
individual to me; &ldquo;I think I shall light my pipe, and smoke
it as I go along.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon he took out from a
side-pocket a tobacco-box and short meerschaum pipe, and
implements for striking a light, filled his pipe, lighted it, and
commenced smoking.&nbsp; Presently the coachman drew near.&nbsp;
I saw at once there was mischief in his eye; the man smoking was
standing with his back towards him, and he came so nigh to him,
seemingly purposely, that as he passed a puff of smoke came of
necessity against his face.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you mean by
smoking in my face?&rdquo; said he, striking the pipe of the
elderly individual out of his mouth.&nbsp; The other, without
manifesting much surprise, said: &ldquo;I thank you; if you will
wait a minute, I will give you a receipt for that favour&rdquo;;
then gathering up his pipe, and taking off his coat and hat, he
laid them on a stepping-block which stood near, and rubbing his
hands together, he advanced towards the coachman in an attitude
of offence, holding his hands crossed very near to his
face.&nbsp; The coachman, who probably expected anything but such
a movement from a person of the age and appearance of the
individual whom he had insulted, stood for a moment motionless
with surprise; but, recollecting himself, he pointed at him
derisively with his finger; the next moment, however, the other
was close upon him, had struck aside the extended hand with his
left fist, and given him a severe blow on the nose with his
right, which he immediately followed by a left-hand blow in the
eye; then drawing his body slightly backward, with the velocity
of lightning he struck the coachman full <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>in the
mouth, and the last blow was the severest of all, for it cut the
coachman&rsquo;s lips nearly through; blows so quickly and
sharply dealt I had never seen.&nbsp; The coachman reeled like a
fir-tree in a gale, and seemed nearly unsensed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ho!
what&rsquo;s this? a fight! a fight!&rdquo; sounded from a dozen
voices, and people came running from all directions to see what
was going on.&nbsp; The coachman coming somewhat to himself,
disencumbered himself of his coat and hat; and, encouraged by two
or three of his brothers of the whip, showed some symptoms of
fighting, endeavouring to close with his foe, but the attempt was
vain, his foe was not to be closed with; he did not shift or
dodge about, but warded off the blows of his opponent with the
greatest <i>sang-froid</i>, always using the guard which I have
already described, and putting in, in return, short, chopping
blows with the swiftness of lightning.&nbsp; In a very few
minutes the countenance of the coachman was literally cut to
pieces, and several of his teeth were dislodged; at length he
gave in; stung with mortification, however, he repented, and
asked for another round; it was granted, to his own complete
demolition.&nbsp; The coachman did not drive his coach back that
day, he did not appear on the box again for a week; but he never
held up his head afterwards.&nbsp; Before I quitted the inn, he
had disappeared from the road, going no one knew where.</p>
<p>The coachman, as I have said before, was very much disliked
upon the road, but there was an <i>esprit de corps</i> amongst
the coachmen, and those who stood by did not like to see their
brother chastised in such tremendous fashion.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
never saw such a fight before,&rdquo; said one.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Fight! why, I don&rsquo;t call it a fight at all; this
chap here ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t got a scratch, whereas Tom is cut to
pieces; it is all along of that guard of his; if Tom could have
got within his guard he would have soon served the old chap
out.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;So he would,&rdquo; said another;
&ldquo;it was all owing to that guard.&nbsp; However, I think I
see into it, and if I had not to drive this afternoon, I would
have a turn with the old fellow and soon serve him
out.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will fight him now for a
guinea,&rdquo; said the other coachman, half taking off his coat;
observing, however, that the elderly individual made a motion
towards him, he hitched it upon his shoulder again, and added,
&ldquo;that is, if he had not been fighting already, but as it
is, I am above taking an advantage, especially of such a poor old
creature as that.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when he had said this, he
looked around him, and there was a feeble titter of approbation
from two or three of the craven crew, who were in the habit of
currying favour with the coachmen.&nbsp; The elderly individual
looked for a moment at these last, and then said: &ldquo;To such
fellows <a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>as you I have nothing to say&rdquo;, then turning to
the coachmen, &ldquo;and as for you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;ye
cowardly bullies, I have but one word, which is, that your reign
upon the roads is nearly over, and that a time is coming when ye
will no longer be wanted or employed in your present capacity,
when ye will either have to drive dung-carts, assist as ostlers
at village ale-houses, or rot in the workhouse.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
putting on his coat and hat, and taking up his bundle, not
forgetting his meerschaum, and the rest of his smoking apparatus,
he departed on his way.&nbsp; Filled with curiosity, I followed
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite astonished that you should be able to use
your hands in the way you have done,&rdquo; said I, as I walked
with this individual in the direction in which he was bound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you how I became able to do so,&rdquo; said
the elderly individual, proceeding to fill and light his pipe as
he walked along.&nbsp; &ldquo;My father was a journeyman
engraver, who lived in a very riotous neighbourhood in the
outskirts of London.&nbsp; Wishing to give me something of an
education, he sent me to a day-school, two or three streets
distant from where we lived, and there, being rather a puny boy,
I suffered much persecution from my schoolfellows, who were a
very blackguard set.&nbsp; One day, as I was running home, with
one of my tormentors pursuing me, old Sergeant Broughton, the
retired fighting-man, seized me by the arm&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;has it ever been your
luck to be acquainted with Sergeant Broughton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may well call it luck,&rdquo; said the elder
individual; &ldquo;but for him I should never have been able to
make my way through the world.&nbsp; He lived only four doors
from our house; so, as I was running along the street, with my
tyrant behind me, Sergeant Broughton seized me by the arm.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Stop, my boy,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I have frequently
seen that scamp ill-treating you; now I will teach you how to
send him home with a bloody nose; down with your bag of books;
and now, my game chick,&rsquo; whispered he to me, placing
himself between me and my adversary, so that he could not observe
his motions, &lsquo;clench your fist in this manner, and hold
your arms in this, and when he strikes at you, move them as I now
show you, and he can&rsquo;t hurt you; now, don&rsquo;t be
afraid, but go at him&rsquo;.&nbsp; I confess that I was somewhat
afraid, but I considered myself in some degree under the
protection of the famous Sergeant, and, clenching my fist, I went
at my foe, using the guard which my ally recommended.&nbsp; The
result corresponded to a certain degree with the predictions of
the Sergeant; I gave my foe a bloody nose and a black eye,
though, notwithstanding my recent lesson in the <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>art of
self-defence, he contrived to give me two or three clumsy
blows.&nbsp; From that moment I was the especial favourite of the
Sergeant, who gave me further lessons, so that in a little time I
became a very fair boxer, beating everybody of my own size who
attacked me.&nbsp; The old gentleman, however, made me promise
never to be quarrelsome, nor to turn his instructions to account,
except in self-defence.&nbsp; I have always borne in mind my
promise, and have made it a point of conscience never to fight
unless absolutely compelled.&nbsp; Folks may rail against boxing
if they please, but being able to box may sometimes stand a quiet
man in good stead.&nbsp; How should I have fared to-day, but for
the instructions of Sergeant Broughton?&nbsp; But for them, the
brutal ruffian who insulted me must have passed unpunished.&nbsp;
He will not soon forget the lesson which I have just given
him&mdash;the only lesson he could understand.&nbsp; What would
have been the use of reasoning with a fellow of that
description?&nbsp; Brave old Broughton!&nbsp; I owe him
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your manner of fighting,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;was
the manner employed by Sergeant Broughton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said my new acquaintance; &ldquo;it was the
manner in which he beat every one who attempted to contend with
him, till, in an evil hour, he entered the ring with Slack,
without any training or preparation, and by a chance blow lost
the battle to a man who had been beaten with ease by those who,
in the hands of Broughton, appeared like so many children.&nbsp;
It was the way of fighting of him who first taught Englishmen to
box scientifically, who was the head and father of the fighters
of what is now called the old school, the last of which were
Johnson and Big Ben.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wonderful man, that Big Ben,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was so,&rdquo; said the elderly individual;
&ldquo;but had it not been for Broughton, I question whether Ben
would have ever been the fighter he was.&nbsp; Oh! there was no
one like old Broughton; but for him I should at the present
moment be sneaking along the road, pursued by the hissings and
hootings of the dirty flatterers of that blackguard
coachman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you mean,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;by those words
of yours, that the coachmen would speedily disappear from the
roads?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that a new method of
travelling is about to be established, which will supersede the
old.&nbsp; I am a poor engraver, as my father was before me; but
engraving is an intellectual trade, and by following it I have
been brought in contact with some of the cleverest men in
England.&nbsp; It has even made me acquainted with the projector
of the scheme, which he <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>has told me many of the wisest heads
of England have been dreaming of during a period of six hundred
years, and which it seems was alluded to by a certain Brazen Head
in the story-book of Friar Bacon, who is generally supposed to
have been a wizard, but in reality was a great philosopher.&nbsp;
Young man, in less than twenty years, by which time I shall be
dead and gone, England will be surrounded with roads of metal, on
which armies may travel with mighty velocity, and of which the
walls of brass and iron by which the friar proposed to defend his
native land are types.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then, shaking me by the
hand, proceeded on his way, whilst I returned to the inn.</p>
<h2><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">few</span> days after the circumstance
which I have last commemorated, it chanced that, as I was
standing at the door of the inn, one of the numerous
stage-coaches which were in the habit of stopping there, drove
up, and several passengers got down.&nbsp; I had assisted a woman
with a couple of children to dismount, and had just delivered to
her a band-box, which appeared to be her only property, which she
had begged me to fetch down from the roof, when I felt a hand
laid upon my shoulder, and heard a voice exclaim: &ldquo;Is it
possible, old fellow, that I find you in this place?&rdquo;&nbsp;
I turned round, and, wrapped in a large blue cloak, I beheld my
good friend Francis Ardry.&nbsp; I shook him most warmly by the
hand, and said: &ldquo;If you are surprised to see me, I am no
less so to see you; where are you bound to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am bound for L&mdash;; at any rate, I am booked for
that sea-port,&rdquo; said my friend in reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry for it,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for in that
case we shall have to part in a quarter of an hour, the coach by
which you came stopping no longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whither are you bound?&rdquo; demanded my
friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am stopping at present in this house, quite
undetermined as to what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come along with me,&rdquo; said Francis Ardry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I can scarcely do,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I have a
horse in the stall which I cannot afford to ruin by racing to
L&mdash; by the side of your coach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My friend mused for a moment: &ldquo;I have no particular
business at L&mdash;,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I was merely going
thither to pass a day or two, till an affair, in which I am
deeply interested, at C&mdash; shall come off.&nbsp; I think I
shall stay with you for four-and-twenty hours at least; I have
been rather melancholy of late, and cannot afford to part with a
friend like you at the present moment; it is an unexpected piece
of good fortune to have met you; and I have not been very
fortunate of late,&rdquo; he added, sighing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am glad to see you once
more, whether fortunate or not; where is your baggage?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>&ldquo;Yon trunk is mine,&rdquo; said Francis, pointing
to a trunk of black Russian leather upon the coach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will soon have it down,&rdquo; said I; and at a word
which I gave to one of the hangers-on of the inn, the trunk was
taken from the top of the coach.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said I
to Francis Ardry, &ldquo;follow me, I am a person of some
authority in this house;&rdquo; thereupon I led Francis Ardry
into the house, and a word which I said to a waiter forthwith
installed Francis Ardry in a comfortable private sitting-room,
and his trunk in the very best sleeping-room of our extensive
establishment.</p>
<p>It was now about one o&rsquo;clock: Francis Ardry ordered
dinner for two, to be ready at four, and a pint of sherry to be
brought forthwith, which I requested my friend the waiter might
be the very best, and which in effect turned out as I requested;
we sat down, and when we had drunk to each other&rsquo;s health,
Frank requested me to make known to him how I had contrived to
free myself from my embarrassments in London, what I had been
about since I quitted that city, and the present posture of my
affairs.</p>
<p>I related to Francis Ardry how I had composed the <i>Life of
Joseph Sell</i>, and how the sale of it to the bookseller had
enabled me to quit London with money in my pocket, which had
supported me during a long course of ramble in the country, into
the particulars of which I, however, did not enter with any
considerable degree of fulness.&nbsp; I summed up my account by
saying that &ldquo;I was at present a kind of overlooker in the
stables of the inn, had still some pounds in my purse, and,
moreover, a capital horse in the stall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No very agreeable posture of affairs,&rdquo; said
Francis Ardry, looking rather seriously at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I make no complaints,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;my
prospects are not very bright, it is true, but sometimes I have
visions both waking and sleeping, which, though always strange,
are invariably agreeable.&nbsp; Last night, in my chamber near
the hayloft, I dreamt that I had passed over an almost
interminable wilderness&mdash;an enormous wall rose before me,
the wall, methought, was the great wall of China: strange figures
appeared to be beckoning to me from the top of the wall; such
visions are not exactly to be sneered at.&nbsp; Not that such
phantasmagoria,&rdquo; said I, raising my voice, &ldquo;are to be
compared for a moment with such desirable things as fashion, fine
clothes, cheques from uncles, parliamentary interest, the love of
splendid females.&nbsp; Ah! woman&rsquo;s love,&rdquo; said I,
and sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the fellow?&rdquo; said
Francis Ardry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing like it,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love, divine love,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound love,&rdquo; said Francis Ardry, &ldquo;I hate
the very name; I have made myself a pretty fool by it, but trust
me for ever being caught at such folly again.&nbsp; In an evil
hour I abandoned my former pursuits and amusements for it; in one
morning spent at Joey&rsquo;s there was more real pleasure than
in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you are not hankering
after dog-fighting again, a sport which none but the gross and
unrefined care anything for?&nbsp; No, one&rsquo;s thoughts
should be occupied by something higher and more rational than
dog-fighting; and what better than love&mdash;divine love?&nbsp;
Oh, there&rsquo;s nothing like it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, don&rsquo;t talk nonsense,&rdquo; said Francis
Ardry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;why I was repeating, to
the best of my recollection, what I heard you say on a former
occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever I talked such stuff,&rdquo; said Francis Ardry,
&ldquo;I was a fool; and indeed I cannot deny that I have been
one: no, there&rsquo;s no denying that I have been a fool.&nbsp;
What do you think? that false Annette has cruelly abandoned
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;perhaps you have yourself
to thank for her having done so; did you never treat her with
coldness, and repay her marks of affectionate interest with
strange fits of eccentric humour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord! how little you know of women,&rdquo; said Francis
Ardry; &ldquo;had I done as you suppose, I should probably have
possessed her at the present moment.&nbsp; I treated her in a
manner diametrically opposite to that.&nbsp; I loaded her with
presents, was always most assiduous to her, always at her feet,
as I may say, yet she nevertheless abandoned me&mdash;and for
whom?&nbsp; I am almost ashamed to say&mdash;for a
fiddler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took a glass of wine, Francis Ardry followed my example, and
then proceeded to detail to me the treatment which he had
experienced from Annette, and from what he said, it appeared that
her conduct to him had been in the highest degree reprehensible;
notwithstanding he had indulged her in everything, she was never
civil to him, but loaded him continually with taunts and insults,
and had finally, on his being unable to supply her with a sum of
money which she had demanded, decamped from the lodgings which he
had taken for her, carrying with her all the presents which at
various times he had bestowed upon her, and had put herself under
the protection of a gentleman who played the bassoon at the
Italian Opera, at which place it appeared that her sister had
lately been engaged as a danseuse.&nbsp; My friend <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>informed me
that at first he had experienced great agony at the ingratitude
of Annette, but at last had made up his mind to forget her, and,
in order more effectually to do so, had left London with the
intention of witnessing a fight, which was shortly coming off at
a town in these parts, between some dogs and a lion; which
combat, he informed me, had for some time past been looked
forward to with intense eagerness by the gentlemen of the
sporting world.</p>
<p>I commended him for his resolution, at the same time advising
him not to give up his mind entirely to dog-fighting, as he had
formerly done, but, when the present combat should be over, to
return to his rhetorical studies, and above all to marry some
rich and handsome lady on the first opportunity, as, with his
person and expectations, he had only to sue for the hand of the
daughter of a marquis to be successful, telling him, with a sigh,
that all women were not Annettes, and that, upon the whole, there
was nothing like them.&nbsp; To which advice he answered, that he
intended to return to rhetoric as soon as the lion fight should
be over, but that he never intended to marry, having had enough
of women; adding that he was glad he had no sister, as, with the
feelings which he entertained with respect to her sex, he should
be unable to treat her with common affection, and concluded by
repeating a proverb which he had learnt from an Arab whom he had
met at Venice, to the effect, that, &ldquo;one who has been stung
by a snake, shivers at the sight of a string&rdquo;.</p>
<p>After a little more conversation, we strolled to the stable,
where my horse was standing; my friend, who was a connoisseur in
horse-flesh, surveyed the animal with attention, and after
inquiring where and how I had obtained him, asked what I intended
to do with him; on my telling him that I was undetermined, and
that I was afraid the horse was likely to prove a burden to me,
he said: &ldquo;It is a noble animal, and if you mind what you
are about, you may make a small fortune by him.&nbsp; I do not
want such an animal myself, nor do I know any one who does; but a
great horse-fair will be held shortly at a place where, it is
true, I have never been, but of which I have heard a great deal
from my acquaintances, where it is said a first-rate horse is
always sure to fetch its value; that place is Horncastle, in
Lincolnshire, you should take him thither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis Ardry and myself dined together, and after dinner
partook of a bottle of the best port which the inn
afforded.&nbsp; After a few glasses, we had a great deal of
conversation; I again brought the subject of marriage and love,
divine love, upon the carpet, but Francis almost immediately
begged me to drop it; and on my <a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>having the delicacy to comply, he
reverted to dog-fighting, on which he talked well and learnedly;
amongst other things, he said that it was a princely sport of
great antiquity, and quoted from Quintus Curtius to prove that
the princes of India must have been of the fancy, they having,
according to that author, treated Alexander to a fight between
certain dogs and a lion.&nbsp; Becoming, notwithstanding my
friend&rsquo;s eloquence and learning, somewhat tired of the
subject, I began to talk about Alexander.&nbsp; Francis Ardry
said he was one of the two great men whom the world has produced,
the other being Napoleon; I replied that I believed Tamerlane was
a greater man than either; but Francis Ardry knew nothing of
Tamerlane, save what he had gathered from the play of Timour the
Tartar.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Alexander and
Napoleon are the great men of the world, their names are known
everywhere.&nbsp; Alexander has been dead upwards of two thousand
years, but the very English bumpkins sometimes christen their
boys by the name of Alexander&mdash;can there be a greater
evidence of his greatness?&nbsp; As for Napoleon, there are some
parts of India in which his bust is worshipped.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Wishing to make up a triumvirate, I mentioned the name of
Wellington, to which Francis Ardry merely said,
&ldquo;bah!&rdquo; and resumed the subject of dog-fighting.</p>
<p>Francis Ardry remained at the inn during that day and the
next, and then departed to the dog and lion fight; I never saw
him afterwards, and merely heard of him once after a lapse of
some years, and what I then heard was not exactly what I could
have wished to hear.&nbsp; He did not make much of the advantages
which he possessed&mdash;a pity, for how great were those
advantages&mdash;person, intellect, eloquence, connection,
riches! yet, with all these advantages, one thing highly needful
seems to have been wanting in Francis.&nbsp; A desire, a craving,
to perform something great and good.&nbsp; Oh! what a vast deal
may be done with intellect, courage, riches, accompanied by the
desire of doing something great and good!&nbsp; Why, a person may
carry the blessings of civilisation and religion to barbarous,
yet at the same time beautiful and romantic, lands; and what a
triumph there is for him who does so! what a crown of
glory!&nbsp; Of far greater value than those surrounding the
brows of your mere conquerors.&nbsp; Yet who has done so in these
times?&nbsp; Not many; not three, not two, something seems to
have been always wanting; there is, however, one instance, in
which the various requisites have been united, and the crown, the
most desirable in the world&mdash;at least which I consider to be
the most desirable&mdash;achieved, and only one, that of Brooke
of Borneo.</p>

163</span>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> never rains but it pours.&nbsp;
I was destined to see at this inn more acquaintances than
one.&nbsp; On the day of Francis Ardry&rsquo;s departure, shortly
after he had taken leave of me, as I was standing in the
corn-chamber, at a kind of writing-table or desk, fastened to the
wall, with a book before me, in which I was making out an account
of the corn and hay lately received and distributed, my friend
the postillion came running in out of breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here
they both are,&rdquo; he gasped out; &ldquo;pray do come and look
at them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom do you mean?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that red-haired Jack Priest, and that idiotic
parson, Platitude; they have just been set down by one of the
coaches, and want a post-chaise to go across the country in; and
what do you think?&nbsp; I am to have the driving of them.&nbsp;
I have no time to lose, for I must get myself ready; so do come
and look at them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hastened into the yard of the inn; two or three of the
helpers of our establishment were employed in drawing forward a
post-chaise out of the chaise-house, which occupied one side of
the yard, and which was spacious enough to contain nearly twenty
of these vehicles, though it was never full, several of them
being always out upon the roads, as the demand upon us for
post-chaises across the country was very great.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There they are,&rdquo; said the postillion, softly,
nodding toward two individuals, in one of whom I recognised the
man in black, and in the other Mr. Platitude; &ldquo;there they
are; have a good look at them, while I go and get
ready.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man in black and Mr. Platitude were
walking up and down the yard; Mr. Platitude was doing his best to
make himself appear ridiculous, talking very loudly in
exceedingly bad Italian, evidently for the purpose of attracting
the notice of the bystanders, in which he succeeded, all the
stable-boys and hangers-on about the yard, attracted by his
vociferation, grinning at his ridiculous figure as he limped up
and down.&nbsp; The man in black said little or nothing, but from
the glances which he cast sideways appeared to be thoroughly
ashamed of his companion; the worthy <a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>couple presently arrived close to
where I was standing, and the man in black, who was nearest to
me, perceiving me, stood still as if hesitating, but recovering
himself in a moment, he moved on without taking any further
notice.&nbsp; Mr. Platitude exclaimed as they passed, in broken
lingo: &ldquo;I hope we shall find the holy doctors all
assembled,&rdquo; and as they returned, &ldquo;I make no doubt
that they will all be rejoiced to see me&rdquo;.&nbsp; Not
wishing to be standing an idle gazer, I went to the chaise and
assisted in attaching the horses, which had now been brought out,
to the pole.&nbsp; The postillion presently arrived, and finding
all ready took the reins and mounted the box, whilst I very
politely opened the door for the two travellers; Mr. Platitude
got in first, and, without taking any notice of me, seated
himself on the farther side.&nbsp; In got the man in black and
seated himself nearest to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;All is right,&rdquo;
said I, as I shut the door, whereupon the postillion cracked his
whip, and the chaise drove out of the yard.&nbsp; Just as I shut
the door, however, and just as Mr. Platitude had recommenced
talking in jergo, at the top of his voice, the man in black
turned his face partly towards me, and gave me a wink with his
left eye.</p>
<p>I did not see my friend the postillion till the next morning,
when he gave me an account of the adventures he had met with on
his expedition.&nbsp; It appeared that he had driven the man in
black and the Reverend Platitude across the country by roads and
lanes which he had some difficulty in threading.&nbsp; At length,
when he had reached a part of the country where he had never been
before, the man in black pointed out to him a house near the
corner of a wood, to which he informed him they were bound.&nbsp;
The postillion said it was a strange-looking house, with a wall
round it, and, upon the whole, bore something of the look of a
madhouse.&nbsp; There was already a post-chaise at the gate, from
which three individuals had alighted&mdash;one of them the
postillion said was a mean-looking scoundrel, with a regular
petty-larceny expression in his countenance.&nbsp; He was dressed
very much like the man in black, and the postillion said that he
could almost have taken his Bible oath that they were both of the
same profession.&nbsp; The other two he said were parsons, he
could swear that, though he had never seen them before; there
could be no mistake about them.&nbsp; Church of England parsons
the postillion swore they were, with their black coats, white
cravats, and airs, in which clumsiness and conceit were most
funnily blended&mdash;Church of England parsons of the Platitude
description, who had been in Italy, and seen the Pope, and kissed
his toe, and picked up a little broken Italian, and come home <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>greater
fools than they went forth.&nbsp; It appeared that they were all
acquaintances of Mr. Platitude, for when the postillion had
alighted and let Mr. Platitude and his companion out of the
chaise, Mr. Platitude shook the whole three by the hand,
conversed with his two brothers in a little broken jergo, and
addressed the petty-larceny looking individual by the title of
Reverend Doctor.&nbsp; In the midst of these greetings, however,
the postillion said the man in black came up to him, and
proceeded to settle with him for the chaise; he had shaken hands
with nobody, and had merely nodded to the others; &ldquo;and
now,&rdquo; said the postillion, &ldquo;he evidently wished to
get rid of me, fearing, probably, that I should see too much of
the nonsense that was going on.&nbsp; It was whilst settling with
me that he seemed to recognise me for the first time, for he
stared hard at me, and at last asked whether I had not been in
Italy; to which question, with a nod and a laugh, I replied that
I had.&nbsp; I was then going to ask him about the health of the
image of Holy Mary, and to say that I hoped it had recovered from
its horsewhipping; but he interrupted me, paid me the money for
the fare, and gave me a crown for myself, saying he would not
detain me any longer.&nbsp; I say, partner, I am a poor
postillion, but when he gave me the crown I had a good mind to
fling it in his face.&nbsp; I reflected, however, that it was not
mere gift-money, but coin which I had earned, and hardly too, so
I put it in my pocket, and I bethought me, moreover, that, knave
as I knew him to be, he had always treated me with civility; so I
nodded to him, and he said something which, perhaps, he meant for
Latin, but which sounded very much like &lsquo;vails,&rsquo; and
by which he doubtless alluded to the money which he had given
me.&nbsp; He then went into the house with the rest, the coach
drove away which had brought the others, and I was about to get
on the box and follow; observing, however, two more chaises
driving up, I thought I would be in no hurry, so I just led my
horses and chaise a little out of the way, and pretending to be
occupied about the harness, I kept a tolerably sharp look-out at
the new arrivals.&nbsp; Well, partner, the next vehicle that
drove up was a gentleman&rsquo;s carriage which I knew very well,
as well as those within it, who were a father and son, the father
a good kind of old gentleman, and a justice of the peace,
therefore, not very wise, as you may suppose; the son a puppy who
has been abroad, where he contrived to forget his own language,
though only nine months absent, and now rules the roast over his
father and mother, whose only child he is, and by whom he is
thought wondrous clever.&nbsp; So this foreigneering chap brings
his poor old father to this out-of-the-way house to <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>meet these
Platitudes and petty-larceny villains, and perhaps would have
brought his mother too, only, simple thing, by good fortune she
happens to be laid up with the rheumatiz.&nbsp; Well, the father
and son, I beg pardon, I mean the son and father, got down and
went in, and then after their carriage was gone, the chaise
behind drove up, in which was a huge fat fellow, weighing twenty
stone at least, but with something of a foreign look, and with
him&mdash;who do you think?&nbsp; Why, a rascally Unitarian
minister, that is, a fellow who had been such a minister, but
who, some years ago leaving his own people, who had bred him up
and sent him to their college at York, went over to the High
Church, and is now, I suppose, going over to some other Church,
for he was talking as he got down, wondrous fast in Latin, or
what sounded something like Latin, to the fat fellow, who
appeared to take things wonderfully easy, and merely grunted to
the dog Latin which the scoundrel had learnt at the expense of
the poor Unitarians at York.&nbsp; So they went into the house,
and presently arrived another chaise, but ere I could make any
further observations, the porter of the out-of-the-way house came
up to me, asking what I was stopping there for? bidding me go
away, and not pry into other people&rsquo;s business.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Pretty business,&rsquo; said I to him, &lsquo;that is
being transacted in a place like this,&rsquo; and then I was
going to say something uncivil, but he went to attend to the new
comers, and I took myself away on my own business as he bade me,
not, however, before observing that these two last were a couple
of blackcoats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The postillion then proceeded to relate how he made the best
of his way to a small public-house, about a mile off, where he
had intended to bait, and how he met on the way a landau and
pair, belonging to a Scotch coxcomb whom he had known in London,
about whom he related some curious particulars, and then
continued: &ldquo;Well, after I had passed him and his turn-out,
I drove straight to the public-house, where I baited my horses,
and where I found some of the chaises and drivers who had driven
the folks to the lunatic-looking mansion, and were now waiting to
take them up again.&nbsp; Whilst my horses were eating their
bait, I sat me down, as the weather was warm, at a table outside,
and smoked a pipe, and drank some ale, in company with the
coachman of the old gentleman who had gone to the house with his
son, and the coachman then told me that the house was a Papist
house, and that the present was a grand meeting of all the fools
and rascals in the country, who came to bow down to images, and
to concert schemes&mdash;pretty schemes no doubt&mdash;for
overturning the religion of the country, and that for his part he
did not <a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>approve of being concerned with such doings, and that
he was going to give his master warning next day.&nbsp; So, as we
were drinking and discoursing, up drove the chariot of the
Scotchman, and down got his valet and the driver, and whilst the
driver was seeing after the horses, the valet came and sat down
at the table where the gentleman&rsquo;s coachman and I were
drinking.&nbsp; I knew the fellow well, a Scotchman like his
master, and just of the same kidney, with white kid gloves, red
hair frizzled, a patch of paint on his face, and his hands
covered with rings.&nbsp; This very fellow, I must tell you, was
one of those most busy in endeavouring to get me turned out of
the servants&rsquo; club in Park Lane, because I happened to
serve a literary man; so he sat down, and in a kind of affected
tone cried out: &lsquo;Landlord, bring me a glass of cold
negus&rsquo;.&nbsp; The landlord, however, told him that there
was no negus, but that if he pleased, he could have a jug of as
good beer as any in the country.&nbsp; &lsquo;Confound the
beer,&rsquo; said the valet, &lsquo;do you think I am accustomed
to such vulgar beverage?&rsquo;&nbsp; However, as he found there
was nothing better to be had, he let the man bring him some beer,
and when he had got it, soon showed that he could drink it easily
enough; so, when he had drunk two or three draughts, he turned
his eyes in a contemptuous manner, first on the coachman, and
then on me; I saw the scamp recollected me, for after staring at
me and my dress for about half a minute, he put on a broad grin,
and flinging his head back, he uttered a loud laugh.&nbsp; Well,
I did not like this, as you may well believe, and taking the pipe
out of my mouth, I asked him if he meant anything personal, to
which he answered, that he had said nothing to me, and that he
had a right to look where he pleased, and laugh when he
pleased.&nbsp; Well, as to a certain extent he was right, as to
looking and laughing, and as I have occasionally looked at a fool
and laughed, though I was not the fool in this instance, I put my
pipe into my mouth and said no more.&nbsp; This quiet and
well-regulated behaviour of mine, however the fellow interpreted
into fear; so, after drinking a little more, he suddenly started
up, and striding once or twice before the table, he asked me what
I meant by that impertinent question of mine, saying that he had
a good mind to wring my nose for my presumption.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
have?&rsquo; said I, getting up, and laying down my pipe.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll now give you an opportunity.&rsquo;&nbsp;
So I put myself in an attitude, and went up to him, saying:
&lsquo;I have an old score to settle with you, you scamp; you
wanted to get me turned out of the club, didn&rsquo;t
you?&rsquo;&nbsp; And thereupon, remembering that he had
threatened to wring my nose, I gave him a snorter <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>upon his
own.&nbsp; I wish you could have seen the fellow when he felt the
smart; so far from trying to defend himself, he turned round, and
with his hand to his face, attempted to run away; but I was now
in a regular passion, and following him up, got before him, and
was going to pummel away at him, when he burst into tears, and
begged me not to hurt him, saying that he was sorry if he had
offended me, and that, if I pleased, he would go down on his
knees, or do anything else I wanted.&nbsp; Well, when I heard him
talk in this manner, I, of course, let him be; I could hardly
help laughing at the figure he cut; his face all blubbered with
tears, and blood and paint; but I did not laugh at the poor
creature either, but went to the table and took up my pipe, and
smoked and drank as if nothing had happened; and the fellow,
after having been to the pump, came and sat down, crying and
trying to curry favour with me and the coachman; presently,
however, putting on a confidential look, he began to talk of the
Popish house, and of the doings there, and said he supposed as
how we were of the party, and that it was all right; and then he
began to talk of the Pope of Rome, and what a nice man he was,
and what a fine thing it was to be of his religion, especially if
folks went over to him; and how it advanced them in the world,
and gave them consideration; and how his master, who had been
abroad and seen the Pope, and kissed his toe, was going over to
the Popish religion, and had persuaded him to consent to do so,
and to forsake his own, which I think the scoundrel called the
&rsquo;Piscopal Church of Scotland, and how many others of that
Church were going over, thinking to better their condition in
life by so doing, and to be more thought on; and how many of the
English Church were thinking of going over too, and that he had
no doubt that it would all end right and comfortably.&nbsp; Well,
as he was going on in this way, the old coachman began to spit,
and getting up, flung all the beer that was in his jug upon the
ground, and going away, ordered another jug of beer, and sat down
at another table, saying that he would not drink in such company;
and I too got up, and flung what beer remained in my
jug&mdash;there wasn&rsquo;t more than a drop&mdash;in the
fellow&rsquo;s face, saying, I would scorn to drink any more in
such company; and then I went to my horses, put them to, paid my
reckoning, and drove home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The postillion having related his story, to which I listened
with all due attention, mused for a moment, and then said:
&ldquo;I daresay you remember how, some time since, when old Bill
had been telling us how the Government a long time ago, had done
away with robbing on the highway, by putting down the
public-houses <a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>and places which the highwaymen frequented, and by
sending out a good mounted police to hunt them down, I said that
it was a shame that the present Government did not employ
somewhat the same means in order to stop the proceedings of Mumbo
Jumbo and his gang now-a-days in England.&nbsp; Howsomever, since
I have driven a fare to a Popish rendezvous, and seen something
of what is going on there, I should conceive that the Government
are justified in allowing the gang the free exercise of their
calling.&nbsp; Anybody is welcome to stoop and pick up nothing,
or worse than nothing, and if Mumbo Jumbo&rsquo;s people, after
their expeditions, return to their haunts with no better plunder
in the shape of converts than what I saw going into yonder place
of call, I should say they are welcome to what they get; for if
that&rsquo;s the kind of rubbish they steal out of the Church of
England, or any other Church, who in his senses but would say a
good riddance, and many thanks for your trouble? at any rate,
that is my opinion of the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was now that I had frequent
deliberations with myself.&nbsp; Should I continue at the inn in
my present position?&nbsp; I was not very much captivated with
it; there was little poetry in keeping an account of the corn,
hay and straw which came in, and was given out, and I was fond of
poetry; moreover, there was no glory at all to be expected in
doing so, and I was fond of glory.&nbsp; Should I give up that
situation, and remaining at the inn, become ostler under old
Bill?&nbsp; There was more poetry in rubbing down horses than in
keeping an account of straw, hay and corn; there was also some
prospect of glory attached to the situation of ostler, for the
grooms and stable-boys occasionally talked of an ostler, a great
way down the road, who had been presented by some sporting
people, not with a silver vase, as our governor had been, but
with a silver currycomb, in testimony of their admiration for his
skill; but I confess that the poetry of rubbing down had become,
as all other poetry becomes, rather prosy by frequent repetition,
and with respect to the chance of deriving glory from the
employment, I entertained, in the event of my determining to
stay, very slight hope of ever attaining skill in the ostler art
sufficient to induce sporting people to bestow upon me a silver
currycomb.&nbsp; I was not half so good an ostler as old Bill,
who had never been presented with a silver currycomb, and I never
expected to become so, therefore what chance had I?&nbsp; It was
true, there was a prospect of some pecuniary emolument to be
derived by remaining in either situation.&nbsp; It was very
probable that, provided I continued to keep an account of the hay
and corn coming in and expended, the landlord would consent to
allow me a pound a week, which at the end of a dozen years,
provided I kept myself sober, would amount to a considerable
sum.&nbsp; I might, on the retirement of old Bill, by taking his
place, save up a decent sum of money, provided, unlike him, I
kept myself sober, and laid by all the shillings and sixpences I
got; but the prospect of laying up a decent sum of money was not
of sufficient importance to induce me to continue either at my
wooden desk, or in the inn-yard.&nbsp; The reader will remember
<a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>what
difficulty I had to make up my mind to become a merchant under
the Armenian&rsquo;s auspices, even with the prospect of making
two or three hundred thousand pounds by following the Armenian
way of doing business, so it was not probable that I should feel
disposed to be book-keeper or ostler all my life with no other
prospect than being able to make a tidy sum of money.&nbsp; If,
indeed, besides the prospect of making a tidy sum at the end of
perhaps forty years&rsquo; ostlering, I had been certain of being
presented with a silver currycomb with my name engraved upon it,
which I might have left to my descendants, or, in default
thereof, to the parish church destined to contain my bones, with
directions that it might be soldered into the wall above the arch
leading from the body of the church into the chancel&mdash;I will
not say with such a certainty of immortality, combined with such
a prospect of moderate pecuniary advantage,&mdash;I might not
have thought it worth my while to stay; but I entertained no such
certainty, and, taking everything into consideration, I
determined to mount my horse and leave the inn.</p>
<p>This horse had caused me for some time past no little
perplexity; I had frequently repented of having purchased him,
more especially as the purchase had been made with another
person&rsquo;s money, and had more than once shown him to people
who, I imagined, were likely to purchase him; but, though they
were profuse in his praise, as people generally are in the praise
of what they don&rsquo;t intend to purchase, they never made me
an offer, and now that I had determined to mount on his back and
ride away, what was I to do with him in the sequel?&nbsp; I could
not maintain him long.&nbsp; Suddenly I bethought me of
Horncastle, which Francis Ardry had mentioned as a place where
the horse was likely to find a purchaser, and not having
determined upon any particular place to which to repair, I
thought that I could do no better than betake myself to
Horncastle in the first instance, and there endeavour to dispose
of my horse.</p>
<p>On making inquiries with respect to the situation of
Horncastle, and the time when the fair would be held, I learned
that the town was situated in Lincolnshire, about a hundred and
fifty miles from the inn at which I was at present sojourning,
and that the fair would be held nominally within about a month,
but that it was always requisite to be on the spot some days
before the nominal day of the fair, as all the best horses were
generally sold before that time, and the people who came to
purchase gone away with what they had bought.</p>
<p>The people of the inn were very sorry on being informed of <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>my
determination to depart.&nbsp; Old Bill told me that he had hoped
as how I had intended to settle down there, and to take his place
as ostler when he was fit for no more work, adding, that though I
did not know much of the business, yet he had no doubt but that I
might improve.&nbsp; My friend the postillion was particularly
sorry, and taking me with him to the tap-room called for two
pints of beer, to one of which he treated me; and whilst we were
drinking told me how particularly sorry he was at the thought of
my going, but that he hoped I should think better of the
matter.&nbsp; On my telling him that I must go, he said that he
trusted I should put off my departure for three weeks, in order
that I might be present at his marriage, the banns of which were
just about to be published.&nbsp; He said that nothing would give
him greater pleasure than to see me dance a minuet with his wife
after the marriage dinner; but I told him it was impossible that
I should stay, my affairs imperatively calling me elsewhere; and
that with respect to my dancing a minuet, such a thing was out of
the question, as I had never learned to dance.&nbsp; At which he
said that he was exceedingly sorry, and finding me determined to
go, wished me success in all my undertakings.</p>
<p>The master of the house, to whom, as in duty bound I
communicated my intention before I spoke of it to the servants,
was, I make no doubt, very sorry, though he did not exactly tell
me so.&nbsp; What he said was, that he had never expected that I
should remain long there, as such a situation never appeared to
him quite suitable to me, though I had been very diligent, and
had given him perfect satisfaction.&nbsp; On his inquiring when I
intended to depart, I informed him next day, whereupon he begged
that I would defer my departure till the next day but one, and do
him the favour of dining with him on the morrow.&nbsp; I informed
him that I should be only too happy.</p>
<p>On the following day at four o&rsquo;clock I dined with the
landlord, in company with a commercial traveller.&nbsp; The
dinner was good, though plain, consisting of boiled
mackerel&mdash;rather a rarity in those parts at that
time&mdash;with fennel sauce, a prime baron of roast beef after
the mackerel, then a tart and noble Cheshire cheese; we had prime
sherry at dinner, and whilst eating the cheese prime porter, that
of Barclay, the only good porter in the world.&nbsp; After the
cloth was removed we had a bottle of very good port; and whilst
partaking of the port I had an argument with the commercial
traveller on the subject of the corn-laws.</p>
<p>The commercial traveller, having worsted me in the argument on
the subject of the corn-laws, got up in great glee, saying that
<a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>he must
order his gig, as business must be attended to.&nbsp; Before
leaving the room, however, he shook me patronisingly by the hand,
and said something to the master of the house, but in so low a
tone that it escaped my ear.</p>
<p>No sooner had he departed than the master of the house told me
that his friend the traveller had just said that I was a
confounded sensible young fellow, and not at all opinionated, a
sentiment in which he himself perfectly agreed; then hemming once
or twice, he said that as I was going on a journey he hoped I was
tolerably well provided with money, adding that travelling was
rather expensive, especially on horseback, the manner in which he
supposed, as I had a horse in the stable, I intended to
travel.&nbsp; I told him that though I was not particularly well
supplied with money, I had sufficient for the expenses of my
journey, at the end of which I hoped to procure more.&nbsp; He
then hemmed again, and said that since I had been at the inn I
had rendered him a great deal of service in more ways than one,
and that he could not think of permitting me to depart without
making me some remuneration; then putting his hand into his
waistcoat pocket, he handed me a cheque for ten pounds, which he
had prepared beforehand, the value of which he said I could
receive at the next town, or that, if I wished it, any waiter in
the house would cash it for me.&nbsp; I thanked him for his
generosity in the best terms I could select, but, handing him
back the cheque, I told him that I could not accept it, saying
that, so far from his being my debtor, I believed myself to be
indebted to him, as not only myself but my horse had been living
at his house for several weeks.&nbsp; He replied, that as for my
board at a house like his it amounted to nothing, and as for the
little corn and hay which the horse had consumed it was of no
consequence, and that he must insist upon my taking the
cheque.&nbsp; But I again declined, telling him that doing so
would be a violation of a rule which I had determined to follow,
and which nothing but the greatest necessity would ever compel me
to break through&mdash;never to incur obligations.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;receiving this money will not
be incurring an obligation, it is your due.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
do not think so,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I did not engage to serve
you for money, nor will I take any from you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Perhaps you will take it as a loan?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I never borrow.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the landlord, smiling, &ldquo;you are
different from all others that I am acquainted with.&nbsp; I
never yet knew any one else who scrupled to borrow and receive
obligations; why, there are two baronets in this neighbourhood
who have borrowed money of me, ay, and who have never repaid what
they borrowed; and there <a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>are a dozen squires who are under
considerable obligations to me, who I daresay will never return
them.&nbsp; Come, you need not be more scrupulous than your
superiors&mdash;I mean in station.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Every
vessel must stand on its own bottom,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;they
take pleasure in receiving obligations, I take pleasure in being
independent.&nbsp; Perhaps they are wise, and I am a fool, I know
not, but one thing I am certain of, which is, that were I not
independent I should be very unhappy: I should have no visions
then.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you any relations?&rdquo; said the
landlord, looking at me compassionately; &ldquo;excuse me, but I
don&rsquo;t think you are exactly fit to take care of
yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There you are mistaken,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;I can take precious good care of myself; ay, and can
drive a precious hard bargain when I have occasion, but driving
bargains is a widely different thing from receiving gifts.&nbsp;
I am going to take my horse to Horncastle, and when there I shall
endeavour to obtain his full value&mdash;ay to the last
penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horncastle!&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;I have
heard of that place; you mustn&rsquo;t be dreaming visions when
you get there, or they&rsquo;ll steal the horse from under
you.&nbsp; Well,&rdquo; said he, rising, &ldquo;I shall not press
you further on the subject of the cheque.&nbsp; I intend,
however, to put you under an obligation to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
then rang the bell, and having ordered two fresh glasses to be
brought, he went out and presently returned with a small pint
bottle, which he uncorked with his own hand; then sitting down,
he said: &ldquo;The wine that I bring here, is port of eighteen
hundred and eleven, the year of the comet, the best vintage on
record; the wine which we have been drinking,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;is good, but not to be compared with this, which I never
sell, and which I am chary of.&nbsp; When you have drunk some of
it, I think you will own that I have conferred an obligation upon
you;&rdquo; he then filled the glasses, the wine which he poured
out diffusing an aroma through the room; then motioning me to
drink, he raised his own glass to his lips, saying: &ldquo;Come,
friend, I drink to your success at Horncastle&rdquo;.</p>
<h2><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">departed</span> from the inn much in the
same fashion as I had come to it, mounted on a splendid horse
indifferently well caparisoned, with the small valise attached to
my crupper, in which, besides the few things I had brought with
me, was a small book of roads with a map, which had been
presented to me by the landlord.&nbsp; I must not forget to state
that I did not ride out of the yard, but that my horse was
brought to me at the front door by old Bill, who insisted upon
doing so, and who refused a five-shilling piece which I offered
him; and it will be as well to let the reader know that the
landlord shook me by the hand as I mounted, and that the people
attached to the inn, male and female&mdash;my friend the
postillion at the head&mdash;assembled before the house to see me
off, and gave me three cheers as I rode away.&nbsp; Perhaps no
person ever departed from an inn with more <i>&eacute;clat</i> or
better wishes; nobody looked at me askance, except two
stage-coachmen who were loitering about, one of whom said to his
companion: &ldquo;I say, Jim! twig his portmanteau! a regular
Newmarket turn-out, by &mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was in the cool of the evening of a bright day&mdash;all
the days of that summer were bright&mdash;that I departed.&nbsp;
I felt at first rather melancholy at finding myself again
launched into the wide world, and leaving the friends whom I had
lately made behind me; but by occasionally trotting the horse,
and occasionally singing a song of Romanvile, I had dispelled the
feeling of melancholy by the time I had proceeded three miles
down the main road.&nbsp; It was at the end of these three miles,
just opposite a milestone, that I struck into a cross road.&nbsp;
After riding about seven miles, threading what are called, in
postillion parlance, cross-country roads, I reached another high
road, tending to the east, along which I proceeded for a mile or
two, when coming to a small inn, about nine o&rsquo;clock, I
halted and put up for the night.</p>
<p>Early on the following morning I proceeded on my journey, but
fearing to gall the horse, I no longer rode him, but led him by
the bridle, until I came to a town at a distance of about ten
miles from the place where I had passed the night.&nbsp; Here I
stayed during the heat of the day, more on the horse&rsquo;s
account <a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>than my own, and towards evening resumed my journey,
leading the animal by the bridle as before; and in this manner I
proceeded for several days, travelling on an average from twenty
to twenty-five miles a day, always leading the animal, except
perhaps now and then of an evening, when, if I saw a good piece
of road before me, I would mount and put the horse into a trot,
which the creature seemed to enjoy as much as myself, showing his
satisfaction by snorting and neighing, whilst I gave utterance to
my own exhilaration by shouts, or by &ldquo;the chi she is kaulo;
she soves pr&eacute; lakie dumo,&rdquo; or by something else of
the same kind in Romanvile.</p>
<p>On the whole, I journeyed along very pleasantly, certainly
quite as pleasantly as I do at present, now that I am become a
gentleman and weigh sixteen stone, though some people would say
that my present manner of travelling is much the most preferable,
riding as I now do, instead of leading my horse; receiving the
homage of ostlers instead of their familiar nods; sitting down to
dinner in the parlour of the best inn I can find, instead of
passing the brightest part of the day in the kitchen of a village
ale-house; carrying on my argument after dinner on the subject of
the corn-laws, with the best commercial gentlemen on the road,
instead of being glad, whilst sipping a pint of beer, to get into
conversation with blind trampers, or maimed Abraham sailors,
regaling themselves on half-pints at the said village
hostelries.&nbsp; Many people will doubtless say that things have
altered wonderfully with me for the better, and they would say
right, provided I possessed now what I then carried about with me
in my journeys&mdash;the spirit of youth.&nbsp; Youth is the only
season for enjoyment, and the first twenty-five years of
one&rsquo;s life are worth all the rest of the longest life of
man, even though those five-and-twenty be spent in penury and
contempt, and the rest in the possession of wealth, honours,
respectability, ay, and many of them in strength and health, such
as will enable one to ride forty miles before dinner, and over
one&rsquo;s pint of port&mdash;for the best gentleman in the land
should not drink a bottle&mdash;carry on one&rsquo;s argument,
with gravity and decorum, with any commercial gentleman who,
responsive to one&rsquo;s challenge, takes the part of humanity
and common sense against &ldquo;protection&rdquo; and the lord of
the land.</p>
<p>Ah! there is nothing like youth&mdash;not that after-life is
valueless.&nbsp; Even in extreme old age one may get on very
well, provided we will but accept of the bounties of God.&nbsp; I
met the other day an old man, who asked me to drink.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am not thirsty,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and will not drink
with you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, you will,&rdquo; said the old
<a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>man,
&ldquo;for I am this day one hundred years old; and you will
never again have an opportunity of drinking the health of a man
on his hundredth birthday.&rdquo;&nbsp; So I broke my word, and
drank.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yours is a wonderful age,&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a long time to look back to the beginning
of it,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;yet, upon the whole, I am
not sorry to have lived it all.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How have you
passed your time?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;As well as I
could,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;always enjoying a good
thing when it came honestly within my reach; not forgetting to
praise God for putting it there.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose
you were fond of a glass of good ale when you were
young?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;I
was; and so, thank God, I am still.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he drank off
a glass of ale.</p>
<p>On I went in my journey, traversing England from west to east,
ascending and descending hills, crossing rivers by bridge and
ferry, and passing over extensive plains.&nbsp; What a beautiful
country is England!&nbsp; People run abroad to see beautiful
countries, and leave their own behind unknown,
unnoticed&mdash;their own the most beautiful!&nbsp; And then,
again, what a country for adventures! especially to those who
travel it on foot, or on horseback.&nbsp; People run abroad in
quest of adventures, and traverse Spain or Portugal on mule or on
horseback; whereas there are ten times more adventures to be met
with in England than in Spain, Portugal, or stupid Germany to
boot.&nbsp; Witness the number of adventures narrated in the
present book&mdash;a book entirely devoted to England.&nbsp; Why,
there is not a chapter in the present book which is not full of
adventures, with the exception of the present one, and this is
not yet terminated.</p>
<p>After traversing two or three counties, I reached the confines
of Lincolnshire.&nbsp; During one particularly hot day I put up
at a public-house, to which, in the evening, came a party of
harvesters to make merry, who, finding me wandering about the
house a stranger, invited me to partake of their ale; so I drank
with the harvesters, who sang me songs about rural life, such
as:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Sitting in the swale; and listening to the swindle
of the flail, as it sounds dub-a-dub on the corn, from the
neighbouring barn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In requital for which I treated them with a song, not of
Romanvile, but the song of &ldquo;Sivord and the horse
Grayman&rdquo;.&nbsp; I remained with them till it was dark,
having, after sunset, entered into deep discourse with a
celebrated ratcatcher, who communicated to me the secrets of his
trade, saying, amongst other things: &ldquo;When you see the rats
pouring out of their holes, and running <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>up my hands
and arms, it&rsquo;s not after me they comes, but after the oils
I carries about me they comes&rdquo;; and who subsequently spoke
in the most enthusiastic manner of his trade, saying that it was
the best trade in the world, and most diverting, and that it was
likely to last for ever; for whereas all other kinds of vermin
were fast disappearing from England, rats were every day becoming
more abundant.&nbsp; I had quitted this good company, and having
mounted my horse, was making my way towards a town at about six
miles distance, at a swinging trot, my thoughts deeply engaged on
what I had gathered from the ratcatcher, when all on a sudden a
light glared upon the horse&rsquo;s face, who purled round in
great terror, and flung me out of the saddle, as from a sling, or
with as much violence as the horse Grayman, in the ballad, flings
Sivord the Snareswayne.&nbsp; I fell upon the ground&mdash;felt a
kind of crashing about my neck&mdash;and forthwith became
senseless.</p>
<h2><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">How</span> long I remained senseless I
cannot say&mdash;for a considerable time, I believe; at length,
opening my eyes, I found myself lying on a bed in a middle-sized
chamber, lighted by a candle, which stood on a table.&nbsp; An
elderly man stood near me, and a yet more elderly female was
holding a phial of very pungent salts to my olfactory
organ.&nbsp; I attempted to move, but felt very stiff; my right
arm appeared nearly paralysed, and there was a strange dull
sensation in my head.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had better remain still,
young man,&rdquo; said the elderly individual, &ldquo;the surgeon
will be here presently; I have sent a message for him to the
neighbouring village.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;and what has happened?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You are in
my house,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;and you have been flung
from a horse.&nbsp; I am sorry to say that I was the cause.&nbsp;
As I was driving home, the lights in my gig frightened the
animal.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is the horse?&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Below, in my stable,&rdquo; said the elderly
individual.&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw you fall, but knowing that on
account of my age I could be of little use to you, I instantly
hurried home&mdash;the accident did not occur more than a furlong
off&mdash;and procuring the assistance of my lad, and two or
three neighbouring cottagers, I returned to the spot where you
were lying senseless.&nbsp; We raised you up, and brought you
here.&nbsp; My lad then went in quest of the horse, who had run
away as we drew nigh.&nbsp; When we saw him first, he was
standing near you; he caught him with some difficulty, and
brought him home.&nbsp; What are you about?&rdquo; said the old
man, as I strove to get off the bed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to see
the horse,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I entreat you to be
still,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;the horse is safe, I
assure you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am thinking about his
knees,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Instead of thinking about your
horse&rsquo;s knees,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;be thankful
that you have not broke your own neck.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You do
not talk wisely,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;when a man&rsquo;s neck is
broke, he is provided for; but when his horse&rsquo;s knees are
broke, he is a lost jockey, that is, if he has nothing but his
horse to depend upon.&nbsp; A pretty figure I should cut at
Horncastle, mounted on a horse blood-raw at the
knees.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, you are going to
Horncastle,&rdquo; said the old man seriously, &ldquo;then I can
<a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>sympathise with you in your anxiety about your horse,
being a Lincolnshire man, and the son of one who bred
horses.&nbsp; I will myself go down into the stable, and examine
into the condition of your horse, so pray remain quiet till I
return; it would certainly be a terrible thing to appear at
Horncastle on a broken-kneed horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He left the room and returned in about ten minutes, followed
by another person.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your horse is safe,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;and his knees are unblemished; not a hair
ruffled.&nbsp; He is a fine animal, and will do credit to
Horncastle; but here is the surgeon come to examine into your own
condition.&rdquo;&nbsp; The surgeon was a man about thirty-five,
thin, and rather tall; his face was long and pale, and his hair,
which was light, was carefully combed back as much as possible
from his forehead.&nbsp; He was dressed very neatly, and spoke in
a very precise tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Allow me to feel your pulse,
friend?&rdquo; said he, taking me by the right wrist.&nbsp; I
uttered a cry, for at the motion which he caused a thrill of
agony darted through my arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope your arm is not
broke, my friend,&rdquo; said the surgeon, &ldquo;allow me to
see; first of all, we must divest you of this cumbrous
frock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The frock was removed with some difficulty, and then the upper
vestments of my frame, with more difficulty still.&nbsp; The
surgeon felt my arm, moving it up and down, causing me
unspeakable pain.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no fracture,&rdquo; said
he at last, &ldquo;but a contusion&mdash;a violent
contusion.&nbsp; I am told you were going to Horncastle; I am
afraid you will be hardly able to ride your horse thither in time
to dispose of him; however, we shall see; your arm must be
bandaged, friend, after which I shall bleed you, and administer a
composing draught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To be short, the surgeon did as he proposed, and when he had
administered the composing draught, he said: &ldquo;Be of good
cheer; I should not be surprised if you are yet in time for
Horncastle&rdquo;.&nbsp; He then departed with the master of the
house, and the woman, leaving me to my repose.&nbsp; I soon began
to feel drowsy, and was just composing myself to slumber, lying
on my back, as the surgeon had advised me, when I heard steps
ascending the stairs, and in a moment more the surgeon entered
again, followed by the master of the house.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope
we don&rsquo;t disturb you,&rdquo; said the former; &ldquo;my
reason for returning is to relieve your mind from any anxiety
with respect to your horse.&nbsp; I am by no means sure that you
will be able, owing to your accident, to reach Horncastle in
time: to quiet you, however, I will buy your horse for any
reasonable sum.&nbsp; I have been down to the stable, and approve
<a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>of his
figure.&nbsp; What do you ask for him?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This
is a strange time of night,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to come to me
about purchasing my horse, and I am hardly in a fitting situation
to be applied to about such a matter.&nbsp; What do you want him
for?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;For my own use,&rdquo; said the surgeon;
&ldquo;I am a professional man, and am obliged to be continually
driving about; I cover at least one hundred and fifty miles every
week.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He will never answer your
purpose,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;he is not a driving horse, and was
never between shafts in his life; he is for riding, more
especially for trotting, at which he has few equals.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;It matters not to me whether he is for riding or
driving,&rdquo; said the surgeon, &ldquo;sometimes I ride,
sometimes drive; so, if we can come to terms, I will buy him,
though, remember, it is chiefly to remove any anxiety from your
mind about him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;This is no time for
bargaining,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;if you wish to have the horse
for a hundred guineas, you may; if not&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;A hundred guineas!&rdquo; said the surgeon; &ldquo;my good
friend, you must surely be light-headed&mdash;allow me to feel
your pulse,&rdquo; and he attempted to feel my left wrist.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am not light-headed,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I require
no one to feel my pulse; but I should be light-headed if I were
to sell my horse for less than I have demanded; but I have a
curiosity to know what you would be willing to
offer.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thirty pounds,&rdquo; said the
surgeon, &ldquo;is all I can afford to give; and that is a great
deal for a country surgeon to offer for a horse.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thirty pounds!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;why, he cost me
nearly double that sum.&nbsp; To tell you the truth, I am afraid
you want to take advantage of my situation.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not in the least, friend,&rdquo; said the surgeon,
&ldquo;not in the least; I only wished to set your mind at rest
about your horse; but as you think he is worth more than I can
afford to offer, take him to Horncastle by all means; I will do
my best to cure you in time.&nbsp; Good-night, I will see you
again on the morrow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thereupon he once more departed
with the master of the house.&nbsp; &ldquo;A sharp one,&rdquo; I
heard him say, with a laugh, as the door closed upon him.</p>
<p>Left to myself, I again essayed to compose myself to rest, but
for some time in vain.&nbsp; I had been terribly shaken by my
fall, and had subsequently, owing to the incision of the
surgeon&rsquo;s lancet, been deprived of much of the vital fluid;
it is when the body is in such a state that the merest trifles
affect and agitate the mind; no wonder, then, that the return of
the surgeon and the master of the house for the purpose of
inquiring whether I would sell my horse, struck me as being
highly extraordinary, considering the hour of the night, and the
situation in which they knew me to be.&nbsp; What could they mean
by such conduct&mdash;<a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>did they wish to cheat me of the
animal?&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if they
did, what matters, they found their match; yes, yes,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;but I am in their power, perhaps&rdquo;&mdash;but I
instantly dismissed the apprehension which came into my mind,
with a pooh, nonsense!&nbsp; In a little time, however, a far
more foolish and chimerical idea began to disturb me&mdash;the
idea of being flung from my horse; was I not disgraced for ever
as a horseman by being flung from my horse?&nbsp; Assuredly I
thought; and the idea of being disgraced as a horseman, operating
on my nervous system, caused me very acute misery.&nbsp;
&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said I to myself, &ldquo;it was perhaps
the contemptible opinion which the surgeon must have formed of my
equestrian powers, which induced him to offer to take my horse
off my hands; he perhaps thought I was unable to manage a horse,
and therefore in pity returned in the dead of night to offer to
purchase the animal which had flung me;&rdquo; and then the
thought that the surgeon had conceived a contemptible opinion of
my equestrian powers, caused me the acutest misery, and continued
tormenting me until some other idea (I have forgot what it was,
but doubtless equally foolish) took possession of my mind.&nbsp;
At length, brought on by the agitation of my spirits, there came
over me the same feeling of horror that I had experienced of old
when I was a boy, and likewise of late within the dingle; it was,
however, not so violent as it had been on those occasions, and I
struggled manfully against it until by degrees it passed away,
and then I fell asleep; and in my sleep I had an ugly
dream.&nbsp; I dreamt that I had died of the injuries I had
received from my fall, and that no sooner had my soul departed
from my body than it entered that of a quadruped, even my own
horse in the stable&mdash;in a word, I was, to all intents and
purposes, my own steed; and as I stood in the stable chewing hay
(and I remembered that the hay was exceedingly tough), the door
opened, and the surgeon who had attended me came in.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My good animal,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as your late master
has scarcely left enough to pay for the expenses of his funeral,
and nothing to remunerate me for my trouble, I shall make bold to
take possession of you.&nbsp; If your paces are good, I shall
keep you for my own riding; if not, I shall take you to
Horncastle, your original destination.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then
bridled and saddled me, and leading me out, mounted, and then
trotted me up and down before the house, at the door of which the
old man, who now appeared to be dressed in regular jockey
fashion, was standing.&nbsp; &ldquo;I like his paces well,&rdquo;
said the surgeon; &ldquo;I think I shall take him for my own
use.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And what am I to have for all the
trouble his master caused me?&rdquo; said my <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>late
entertainer, on whose countenance I now observed, for the first
time, a diabolical squint.&nbsp; &ldquo;The consciousness of
having done your duty to a fellow-creature in succouring him in a
time of distress, must be your reward,&rdquo; said the
surgeon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pretty gammon, truly,&rdquo; said my late
entertainer.&nbsp; &ldquo;What would you say if I were to talk in
that way to you?&nbsp; Come, unless you choose to behave jonnock,
I shall take the bridle and lead the horse back into the
stable.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the surgeon,
&ldquo;we are old friends, and I don&rsquo;t wish to dispute with
you, so I&rsquo;ll tell you what I will do.&nbsp; I will ride the
animal to Horncastle, and we will share what he fetches like
brothers.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the old man,
&ldquo;but if you say that you have sold him for less than a
hundred, I shan&rsquo;t consider you jonnock; remember what the
young fellow said&mdash;that young fellow&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; I
heard no more, for the next moment I found myself on a broad road
leading, as I supposed, in the direction of Horncastle, the
surgeon still in the saddle, and my legs moving at a rapid
trot.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get on,&rdquo; said the surgeon, jerking my
mouth with the bit; whereupon, full of rage, I instantly set off
at full gallop, determined, if possible, to dash my rider to the
earth.&nbsp; The surgeon, however, kept his seat, and so far from
attempting to abate my speed, urged me on to greater efforts with
a stout stick, which methought he held in his hand.&nbsp; In vain
did I rear and kick, attempting to get rid of my foe; but the
surgeon remained as saddle-fast as ever the Maugrabin sorcerer in
the Arabian tale, what time he rode the young prince transformed
into a steed to his enchanted palace in the wilderness.&nbsp; At
last, as I was still madly dashing on, panting and blowing, and
had almost given up all hope, I saw at a distance before me a
heap of stones by the side of the road, probably placed there for
the purpose of repairing it; a thought appeared to strike
me&mdash;I will shy at those stones, and, if I can&rsquo;t get
rid of him so, resign myself to my fate.&nbsp; So I increased my
speed, till arriving within about ten yards of the heap, I made a
desperate start, turning half-round with nearly the velocity of a
mill-stone.&nbsp; Oh, the joy I experienced when I felt my enemy
canted over my neck, and saw him lying senseless in the
road.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have you now in my power,&rdquo; I said, or
rather neighed, as, going up to my prostrate foe, I stood over
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Suppose I were to rear now, and let my fore
feet fall upon you, what would your life be worth? that is,
supposing you are not killed already; but lie there, I will do
you no further harm, but trot to Horncastle without a rider, and
when there&mdash;&rdquo; and without further reflection off I
trotted in the direction of Horncastle, but had not gone far
before my bridle, falling from <a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>my neck, got entangled with my off
fore foot.&nbsp; I felt myself falling, a thrill of agony shot
through me&mdash;my knees would be broken, and what should I do
at Horncastle with a pair of broken knees; I struggled, but I
could not disengage my off fore foot, and downward I fell, but
before I had reached the ground I awoke, and found myself half
out of bed, my bandaged arm in considerable pain, and my left
hand just touching the floor.</p>
<p>With some difficulty I readjusted myself in bed.&nbsp; It was
now early morning, and the first rays of the sun were beginning
to penetrate the white curtains of a window on my left, which
probably looked into a garden, as I caught a glimpse or two of
the leaves of trees through a small uncovered part at the
side.&nbsp; For some time I felt uneasy and anxious, my spirits
being in a strange fluttering state.&nbsp; At last my eyes fell
upon a small row of teacups, seemingly of china, which stood on a
mantelpiece exactly fronting the bottom of the bed.&nbsp; The
sight of these objects, I know not why, soothed and pacified me;
I kept my eyes fixed upon them, as I lay on my back on the bed,
with my head upon the pillow, till at last I fell into a calm and
refreshing sleep.</p>

185</span>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> might be about eight
o&rsquo;clock in the morning when I was awakened by the entrance
of the old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;How have you rested?&rdquo; said he,
coming up to the bedside, and looking me in the face.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I feel much better, but I
am still very sore.&rdquo;&nbsp; I surveyed him now for the first
time with attention.&nbsp; He was dressed in a sober-coloured
suit, and was apparently between sixty and seventy.&nbsp; In
stature he was rather above the middle height, but with a slight
stoop; his features were placid, and expressive of much
benevolence, but as it appeared to me, with rather a melancholy
cast.&nbsp; As I gazed upon them, I felt ashamed that I should
ever have conceived in my brain a vision like that of the
preceding night, in which he appeared in so disadvantageous a
light.&nbsp; At length he said: &ldquo;It is now time for you to
take some refreshment.&nbsp; I hear my old servant coming up with
your breakfast.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a moment the elderly female
entered with a tray, on which was some bread and butter, a teapot
and cup.&nbsp; The cup was of common blue earthenware, but the
pot was of china, curiously fashioned, and seemingly of great
antiquity.&nbsp; The old man poured me out a cupful of tea, and
then, with the assistance of the woman, raised me higher, and
propped me up with pillows.&nbsp; I ate and drank; when the pot
was emptied of its liquid (it did not contain much), I raised it
up with my left hand to inspect it.&nbsp; The sides were covered
with curious characters, seemingly hieroglyphics.&nbsp; After
surveying them for some time, I replaced it upon the tray.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You seem fond of china,&rdquo; said I to the old man,
after the servant had retired with the breakfast things, and I
had returned to my former posture; &ldquo;you have china on the
mantelpiece, and that was a remarkable teapot out of which I have
just been drinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man fixed his eyes intently on me, and methought the
expression of his countenance became yet more melancholy.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he at last, &ldquo;I am fond of
china&mdash;I have reason to be fond of china&mdash;but for china
I should&mdash;&rdquo; and here he sighed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You value it for the quaintness and singularity of its
form,&rdquo; <a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>said I; &ldquo;it appears to be less adapted for real
use than our own pottery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I care little about its form,&rdquo; said the old man;
&ldquo;I care for it simply on account of &mdash; however, why
talk to you on the subject which can have no possible interest
for you?&nbsp; I expect the surgeon here presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not like that surgeon at all,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;how strangely he behaved last night, coming back, when I
was just falling asleep, to ask me if I would sell my
horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has but one
failing,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;an itch for horse-dealing; but
for that he might be a much richer man than he is; he is
continually buying and exchanging horses, and generally finds
himself a loser by his bargains: but he is a worthy creature, and
skilful in his profession; it is well for you that you are under
his care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man then left me, and in about an hour returned with
the surgeon, who examined me and reported favourably as to my
case.&nbsp; He spoke to me with kindness and feeling, and did not
introduce the subject of the horse.&nbsp; I asked him whether he
thought I should be in time for the fair.&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw some
people making their way thither to-day,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;the fair lasts three weeks, and it has just
commenced.&nbsp; Yes, I think I may promise you that you will be
in time for the very heat of it.&nbsp; In a few days you will be
able to mount your saddle with your arm in a sling, but you must
by no means appear with your arm in a sling at Horncastle, as
people would think that your horse had flung you, and that you
wanted to dispose of him because he was a vicious brute.&nbsp;
You must, by all means, drop the sling before you get to
Horncastle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For three days I kept my apartment by the advice of the
surgeon.&nbsp; I passed my time as I best could.&nbsp; Stretched
on my bed, I either abandoned myself to reflection, or listened
to the voices of the birds in the neighbouring garden.&nbsp;
Sometimes, as I lay awake at night, I would endeavour to catch
the tick of a clock, which methought sounded from some distant
part of the house.</p>
<p>The old man visited me twice or thrice every day to inquire
into my state.&nbsp; His words were few on these occasions, and
he did not stay long.&nbsp; Yet his voice and his words were
kind.&nbsp; What surprised me most in connection with this
individual was, the delicacy of conduct which he exhibited in not
letting a word proceed from his lips which could testify
curiosity respecting who I was, or whence I came.&nbsp; All he
knew of me was, that I had been flung from my horse on my way to
a fair for the purpose of disposing <a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>of the animal, and that I was now
his guest.&nbsp; I might be a common horse-dealer for what he
knew, yet I was treated by him with all the attention which I
could have expected, had I been an alderman of Boston&rsquo;s
heir, and known to him as such.&nbsp; The county in which I am
now, thought I at last, must be either extraordinarily devoted to
hospitality, or this old host of mine must be an extraordinary
individual.&nbsp; On the evening of the fourth day, feeling tired
of my confinement, I put my clothes on in the best manner I
could, and left the chamber.&nbsp; Descending a flight of stairs,
I reached a kind of quadrangle, from which branched two or three
passages; one of these I entered, which had a door at the farther
end, and one on each side; the one to the left standing partly
open, I entered it, and found myself in a middle-sized room with
a large window, or rather glass door, which looked into a garden,
and which stood open.&nbsp; There was nothing remarkable in this
room, except a large quantity of china.&nbsp; There was china on
the mantelpiece, china on two tables, and a small beaufet, which
stood opposite the glass door, was covered with china; there were
cups, teapots and vases of various forms, and on all of them I
observed characters&mdash;not a teapot, not a teacup, not a vase
of whatever form or size, but appeared to possess hieroglyphics
on some part or other.&nbsp; After surveying these articles for
some time with no little interest, I passed into the garden, in
which there were small parterres of flowers, and two or three
trees, and which, where the house did not abut, was bounded by a
wall; turning to the right by a walk by the side of the house, I
passed by a door&mdash;probably the one I had seen at the end of
the passage&mdash;and arrived at another window similar to that
through which I had come, and which also stood open; I was about
to pass by it; when I heard the voice of my entertainer
exclaiming: &ldquo;Is that you? pray come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I entered the room, which seemed to be a counterpart of the
one which I had just left.&nbsp; It was of the same size, had the
same kind of furniture, and appeared to be equally well stocked
with china; one prominent article it possessed, however, which
the other room did not exhibit&mdash;namely, a clock, which, with
its pendulum moving tick-a-tick, hung against the wall opposite
to the door, the sight of which made me conclude that the sound
which methought I had heard in the stillness of the night was not
an imaginary one.&nbsp; There it hung on the wall, with its
pendulum moving tick-a-tick.&nbsp; The old gentleman was seated
in an easy-chair a little way into the room, having the glass
door on his right hand.&nbsp; On a table before him lay a large
open volume, in which I observed Roman letters <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>as well as
characters.&nbsp; A few inches beyond the book on the table,
covered all over with hieroglyphics, stood a china vase.&nbsp;
The eyes of the old man were fixed upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; said he, motioning me with his hand to
a stool close by, but without taking his eyes from the vase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make it out,&rdquo; said he at last,
removing his eyes from the vase, and leaning back on the chair,
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could assist you,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assist me,&rdquo; said the old man, looking at me with
a half smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I do not understand
Chinese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; said the old man, with another
slight smile; &ldquo;but&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray proceed,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wished to ask you,&rdquo; said the old man,
&ldquo;how you knew that the characters on yon piece of crockery
were Chinese; or, indeed, that there was such a
language?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew the crockery was china,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;and naturally enough supposed what was written upon it to
be Chinese; as for there being such a language&mdash;the English
have a language, the French have a language, and why not the
Chinese?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask you a question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As many as you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know any language besides English?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I know a little of two or
three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask their names?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I know a little
French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a little Welsh, and a little Haik.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is Haik?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Armenian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to see you in my house,&rdquo; said the old
man, shaking me by the hand; &ldquo;how singular that one coming
as you did should know Armenian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not more singular,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;than that one
living in such a place as this should know Chinese.&nbsp; How
came you to acquire it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man looked at me, and sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I beg
pardon,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for asking what is, perhaps, an
impertinent question; I have not imitated your own delicacy; you
have never asked me a question without first desiring permission,
and here I have been days and nights in your house an intruder on
your hospitality, and you have never so much as asked me who I
am.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>&ldquo;In forbearing to do that,&rdquo; said the old
man, &ldquo;I merely obeyed the Chinese precept: &lsquo;Ask no
questions of a guest&rsquo;; it is written on both sides of the
teapot out of which you have had your tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew Chinese,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is
it a difficult language to acquire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have reason to think so,&rdquo; said the old
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been occupied upon it five-and-thirty
years, and I am still very imperfectly acquainted with it; at
least, I frequently find upon my crockery sentences the meaning
of which to me is very dark, though it is true these sentences
are mostly verses, which are, of course, more difficult to
understand than mere prose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are your Chinese studies,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;confined to crockery literature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Entirely,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;I read
nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that the Chinese
have no letters, but that for every word they have a separate
character&mdash;is it so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For every word they have a particular character,&rdquo;
said the old man; &ldquo;though, to prevent confusion, they have
arranged their words under two hundred and fourteen what we
should call radicals, but which they call keys.&nbsp; As we
arrange all our words in a dictionary under twenty-four letters,
so do they arrange all their words, or characters, under two
hundred and fourteen radical signs; the simplest radicals being
the first, and the more complex the last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does the Chinese resemble any of the European languages
in words?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am scarcely competent to inform you,&rdquo; said the
old man; &ldquo;but I believe not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that character represent?&rdquo; said I,
pointing to one on the vase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A knife,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;that character
is one of the simplest radicals or keys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is the sound of it?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Tau</i>,&rdquo; said the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tau,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;tau!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A strange word for a knife! is it not?&rdquo; said the
old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tawse!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;tawse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is tawse?&rdquo; said the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were never at school at Edinburgh, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That accounts for your not knowing the meaning of
tawse,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;had you received the rudiments of a
classical education <a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>at the High School, you would have
known the meaning of tawse full well.&nbsp; It is a leathern
thong, with which refractory urchins are recalled to a sense of
their duty by the dominie.&nbsp; Tau&mdash;tawse&mdash;how
singular!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot see what the two words have in common, except
a slight agreement in sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will see the connection,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;when
I inform you that the thong, from the middle to the bottom, is
cut or slit into two or three parts, from which slits or cuts,
unless I am very much mistaken, it derives its name&mdash;tawse,
a thong with slits or cuts, used for chastising disorderly
urchins at the High School, from the French <i>tailler</i>, to
cut; evidently connected with the Chinese tau, a knife&mdash;how
very extraordinary!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> days&mdash;three days passed
away, and I still remained at the house of my hospitable
entertainer, my bruised limb rapidly recovering the power of
performing its functions.&nbsp; I passed my time agreeably
enough, sometimes in my chamber, communing with my own thoughts;
sometimes in the stable, attending to, and not unfrequently
conversing with, my horse; and at meal-time&mdash;for I seldom
saw him at any other&mdash;discoursing with the old gentleman,
sometimes on the Chinese vocabulary, sometimes on Chinese syntax,
and once or twice on English horseflesh, though on this latter
subject, notwithstanding his descent from a race of
horse-traders, he did not enter with much alacrity.&nbsp; As a
small requital for his kindness, I gave him one day, after
dinner, unasked, a brief account of my history and
pursuits.&nbsp; He listened with attention, and when it was
concluded, thanked me for the confidence which I had reposed in
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Such conduct,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;deserves a
return.&nbsp; I will tell you my own history; it is brief, but
may perhaps not prove uninteresting to you&mdash;though the
relation of it will give me some pain.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray,
then, do not recite it,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
said the old man, &ldquo;I will tell you, for I wish you to know
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was about to begin, when he was interrupted
by the arrival of the surgeon.&nbsp; The surgeon examined into
the state of my bruised limb, and told me, what indeed I already
well knew, that it was rapidly improving.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will
not even require a sling,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to ride to
Horncastle.&nbsp; When do you propose going?&rdquo; he
demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;When do you think I may venture?&rdquo; I
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think, if you are a tolerably good
horseman, you may mount the day after to-morrow,&rdquo; answered
the medical man.&nbsp; &ldquo;By-the-bye, are you acquainted with
anybody at Horncastle?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;With no living
soul,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you would scarcely
find stable-room for your horse.&nbsp; But I am happy to be able
to assist you.&nbsp; I have a friend there who keeps a small inn,
and who, during the time of the fair, keeps a stall vacant for
any quadruped I may bring, until he knows whether I am coming or
not.&nbsp; I will give you a letter to him, and he will see after
the accommodation of your horse.&nbsp; To-morrow <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>I will pay
you a farewell visit, and bring you the letter.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;and do not forget to
bring your bill.&rdquo;&nbsp; The surgeon looked at the old man,
who gave him a peculiar nod.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said he, in
reply to me, &ldquo;for the little service I have rendered you, I
require no remuneration.&nbsp; You are in my friend&rsquo;s
house, and he and I understand each other.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
never receive such favours,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;as you have
rendered me, without remunerating them; therefore, I shall expect
your bill.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! just as you please,&rdquo;
said the surgeon; and shaking me by the hand more warmly than he
had hitherto done, he took his leave.</p>
<p>On the evening of the next day, the last which I spent with my
kind entertainer, I sat at tea with him in a little summer-house
in his garden, partially shaded by the boughs of a large
fig-tree.&nbsp; The surgeon had shortly before paid me his
farewell visit, and had brought me the letter of introduction to
his friend at Horncastle, and also his bill, which I found
anything but extravagant.&nbsp; After we had each respectively
drank the contents of two cups&mdash;and it may not be amiss here
to inform the reader that though I took cream with my tea, as I
always do when I can procure that addition, the old man, like
most people bred up in the country, drank his without it&mdash;he
thus addressed me: &ldquo;I am, as I told you on the night of
your accident, the son of a breeder of horses, a respectable and
honest man.&nbsp; When I was about twenty he died, leaving me,
his only child, a comfortable property, consisting of about two
hundred acres of land and some fifteen hundred pounds in
money.&nbsp; My mother had died about three years
previously.&nbsp; I felt the death of my mother keenly, but that
of my father less than was my duty; indeed, truth compels me to
acknowledge that I scarcely regretted his death.&nbsp; The cause
of this want of proper filial feeling was the opposition which I
had experienced from him in an affair which deeply concerned
me.&nbsp; I had formed an attachment for a young female in the
neighbourhood, who, though poor, was of highly respectable birth,
her father having been a curate of the Established Church.&nbsp;
She was, at the time of which I am speaking, an orphan, having
lost both her parents, and supported herself by keeping a small
school.&nbsp; My attachment was returned, and we had pledged our
vows, but my father, who could not reconcile himself to her lack
of fortune, forbade our marriage in the most positive
terms.&nbsp; He was wrong, for she was a fortune in
herself&mdash;amiable and accomplished.&nbsp; Oh! I cannot tell
you all she was&mdash;&rdquo; and here the old man drew his hand
across his eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;By the death of my father, the only
obstacle to our happiness appeared to be removed.&nbsp; We
agreed, therefore, <a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>that our marriage should take place within the course
of a year, and I forthwith commenced enlarging my house and
getting my affairs in order.&nbsp; Having been left in the easy
circumstances which I have described, I determined to follow no
business, but to pass my life in a strictly domestic manner, and
to be very, very happy.&nbsp; Amongst other property derived from
my father were several horses, which I disposed of in this
neighbourhood, with the exception of two remarkably fine ones,
which I determined to take to the next fair at Horncastle, the
only place where I expected to be able to obtain what I
considered to be their full value.&nbsp; At length the time
arrived for the commencement of the fair, which was within three
months of the period which my beloved and myself had fixed upon
for the celebration of our nuptials.&nbsp; To the fair I went, a
couple of trusty men following me with the horses.&nbsp; I soon
found a purchaser for the animals, a portly, plausible person, of
about forty, dressed in a blue riding coat, brown top boots, and
leather breeches.&nbsp; There was a strange-looking urchin with
him, attired in nearly similar fashion, with a beam in one of his
eyes, who called him father.&nbsp; The man paid me for the
purchase in bank-notes&mdash;three fifty-pound notes for the two
horses.&nbsp; As we were about to take leave of each other, he
suddenly produced another fifty-pound note, inquiring whether I
could change it, complaining, at the same time, of the difficulty
of procuring change in the fair.&nbsp; As I happened to have
plenty of small money in my possession, and as I felt obliged to
him for having purchased my horses at what I considered to be a
good price, I informed him that I should be very happy to
accommodate him; so I changed him the note, and he, having taken
possession of the horses, went his way, and I myself returned
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A month passed; during this time I paid away two of the
notes which I had received at Horncastle from the
dealer&mdash;one of them in my immediate neighbourhood, and the
other at a town about fifteen miles distant, to which I had
repaired for the purpose of purchasing some furniture.&nbsp; All
things seemed to be going on most prosperously, and I felt quite
happy, when one morning, as I was overlooking some workmen who
were employed about my house, I was accosted by a constable, who
informed me that he was sent to request my immediate appearance
before a neighbouring bench of magistrates.&nbsp; Concluding that
I was merely summoned on some unimportant business connected with
the neighbourhood, I felt no surprise, and forthwith departed in
company with the officer.&nbsp; The demeanour of the man upon the
way struck me as somewhat singular.&nbsp; I had frequently spoken
<a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>to him
before, and had always found him civil and respectful, but he was
now reserved and sullen, and replied to two or three questions
which I put to him in anything but a courteous manner.&nbsp; On
arriving at the place where the magistrates were sitting&mdash;an
inn at a small town about two miles distant&mdash;I found a more
than usual number of people assembled, who appeared to be
conversing with considerable eagerness.&nbsp; At sight of me they
became silent, but crowded after me as I followed the man into
the magistrates&rsquo; room.&nbsp; There I found the tradesman to
whom I had paid the note for the furniture at the town fifteen
miles off in attendance, accompanied by an agent of the Bank of
England; the former, it seems, had paid the note into a
provincial bank, the proprietors of which, discovering it to be a
forgery, had forthwith written up to the Bank of England, who had
sent down their agent to investigate the matter.&nbsp; A third
individual stood beside them&mdash;the person in my own immediate
neighbourhood to whom I had paid the second note; this, by some
means or other, before the coming down of the agent, had found
its way to the same provincial bank, and also being pronounced a
forgery, it had speedily been traced to the person to whom I had
paid it.&nbsp; It was owing to the apparition of this second note
that the agent had determined, without further inquiry, to cause
me to be summoned before the rural tribunal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a few words the magistrates&rsquo; clerk gave me to
understand the state of the case.&nbsp; I was filled with
surprise and consternation.&nbsp; I knew myself to be perfectly
innocent of any fraudulent intention, but at the time of which I
am speaking it was a matter fraught with the greatest danger to
be mixed up, however innocently, with the passing of false
money.&nbsp; The law with respect to forgery was terribly severe,
and the innocent as well as the guilty occasionally
suffered.&nbsp; Of this I was not altogether ignorant;
unfortunately, however, in my transactions with the stranger, the
idea of false notes being offered to me, and my being brought
into trouble by means of them, never entered my mind.&nbsp;
Recovering myself a little, I stated that the notes in question
were two of three notes which I had received at Horncastle, for a
pair of horses, which it was well known I had carried
thither.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thereupon, I produced from my pocket-book the third
note, which was forthwith pronounced a forgery.&nbsp; I had
scarcely produced the third note, when I remembered the one which
I had changed for the Horncastle dealer, and with the remembrance
came the almost certain conviction that it was also a forgery; I
was tempted for a moment to produce it, and to explain the
circumstance&mdash;<a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>would to God I had done so!&mdash;but shame at the idea
of having been so wretchedly duped prevented me, and the
opportunity was lost.&nbsp; I must confess that the agent of the
bank behaved, upon the whole, in a very handsome manner; he said
that as it was quite evident that I had disposed of certain
horses at the fair, it was very possible that I might have
received the notes in question in exchange for them, and that he
was willing, as he had received a very excellent account of my
general conduct, to press the matter no further, that is,
provided&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; And here he stopped.&nbsp;
Thereupon, one of the three magistrates who were present asked me
whether I chanced to have any more of these spurious notes in my
possession.&nbsp; He certainly had a right to ask the question;
but there was something peculiar in his tone&mdash;insinuating
suspicion.&nbsp; It is certainly difficult to judge of the
motives which rule a person&rsquo;s conduct, but I cannot help
imagining that he was somewhat influenced in his behaviour on
that occasion, which was anything but friendly, by my having
refused to sell him the horses at a price less than that which I
expected to get at the fair; be this as it may, the question
filled me with embarrassment, and I bitterly repented not having
at first been more explicit.&nbsp; Thereupon the magistrate, in
the same kind of tone, demanded to see my pocket-book.&nbsp; I
knew that to demur would be useless, and produced it, and
therewith, amongst two or three small country notes, appeared the
fourth which I had received from the Horncastle dealer.&nbsp; The
agent took it up and examined it with attention.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well, is it a genuine note?&rsquo; asked the
magistrate.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am sorry to say that it is not,&rsquo;
said the agent; &lsquo;it is a forgery, like the other
three.&rsquo;&nbsp; The magistrate shrugged his shoulders, as
indeed did several people in the room.&nbsp; &lsquo;A regular
dealer in forged notes,&rsquo; said a person close behind me;
&lsquo;who would have thought it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeing matters begin to look so serious, I aroused
myself, and endeavoured to speak in my own behalf, giving a
candid account of the manner in which I became possessed of the
notes, but my explanation did not appear to meet much
credit.&nbsp; The magistrate, to whom I have in particular
alluded, asked, why I had not at once stated the fact of my
having received a fourth note; and the agent, though in a very
quiet tone, observed that he could not help thinking it somewhat
strange that I should have changed a note of so much value for a
perfect stranger, even supposing that he had purchased my horses,
and had paid me their value in hard cash; and I noticed that he
laid particular emphasis on the last words.&nbsp; I might have
observed that I was an inexperienced young man, <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>who,
meaning no harm myself, suspected none in others, but I was
confused, stunned, and my tongue seemed to cleave to the roof of
my mouth.&nbsp; The men who had taken my horses to Horncastle,
and for whom I had sent, as they lived close at hand, now
arrived, but the evidence which they could give was anything but
conclusive in my favour; they had seen me in company with an
individual at Horncastle, to whom, by my orders, they had
delivered certain horses, but they had seen no part of the money
transaction; the fellow, whether from design or not, having taken
me aside into a retired place, where he had paid me three
spurious notes, and induced me to change the fourth, which
throughout the affair was what bore most materially against
me.&nbsp; How matters might have terminated I do not know; I
might have gone to prison, and I might have been&mdash;&nbsp;
Just then, when I most needed a friend, and least expected to
find one, for though amongst those present there were several who
were my neighbours, and who had professed friendship for me, none
of them when they saw that I needed support and encouragement,
came forward to yield me any, but, on the contrary, appeared by
their looks to enjoy my terror and confusion&mdash;just then a
friend entered the room in the person of the surgeon of the
neighbourhood, the father of him who has attended you; he was not
on very intimate terms with me, but he had occasionally spoken to
me, and had attended my father in his dying illness, and chancing
to hear that I was in trouble, he now hastened to assist
me.&nbsp; After a short preamble, in which he apologised to the
bench for interfering, he begged to be informed of the state of
the case, whereupon the matter was laid before him in all its
details.&nbsp; He was not slow in taking a fair view of it, and
spoke well and eloquently in my behalf, insisting on the
improbability that a person of my habits and position would be
wilfully mixed up with a transaction like that of which it
appeared I was suspected, adding, that as he was fully convinced
of my innocence, he was ready to enter into any surety with
respect to my appearance at any time to answer anything which
might be laid to my charge.&nbsp; This last observation had
particular effect, and as he was a person universally respected,
both for his skill in his profession and his general demeanour,
people began to think that a person in whom he took an interest
could scarcely be concerned in anything criminal, and though my
friend the magistrate&mdash;I call him so ironically&mdash;made
two or three demurs, it was at last agreed between him and his
brethren of the bench, that, for the present, I should be merely
called upon to enter into my own recognisance for the sum of two
hundred pounds, to appear whenever it should <a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>be deemed
requisite to enter into any further investigation of the
matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I was permitted to depart from the tribunal of petty
justice without handcuffs, and uncollared by a constable; but
people looked coldly and suspiciously upon me.&nbsp; The first
thing I did was to hasten to the house of my beloved, in order to
inform her of every circumstance attending the transaction.&nbsp;
I found her, but how?&nbsp; A malicious female individual had
hurried to her with a distorted tale, to the effect that I had
been taken up as an utterer of forged notes; that an immense
number had been found in my possession; that I was already
committed, and that probably I should be executed.&nbsp; My
affianced one tenderly loved me, and her constitution was
delicate; fit succeeded fit; she broke a blood-vessel, and I
found her deluged in blood; the surgeon had just been sent for;
he came and afforded her every possible relief.&nbsp; I was
distracted; he bade me have hope, but I observed he looked very
grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the skill of the surgeon, the poor girl was saved in
the first instance from the arms of death, and for a few weeks
she appeared to be rapidly recovering; by degrees, however, she
became melancholy; a worm preyed upon her spirit; a slow fever
took possession of her frame.&nbsp; I subsequently learned that
the same malicious female who had first carried to her an
exaggerated account of the affair, and who was a distant relative
of her own, frequently visited her, and did all in her power to
excite her fears with respect to its eventual termination.&nbsp;
Time passed on in a very wretched manner, our friend the surgeon
showing to us both every mark of kindness and attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was owing to this excellent man that my innocence
was eventually established.&nbsp; Having been called to a town on
the borders of Yorkshire to a medical consultation, he chanced to
be taking a glass of wine with the landlord of the inn at which
he stopped, when the waiter brought in a note to be changed,
saying, &lsquo;That the Quaker gentleman, who had been for some
days in the house, and was about to depart, had sent it to be
changed, in order that he might pay his bill&rsquo;.&nbsp; The
landlord took the note, and looked at it.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
fifty-pound bill,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like
changing bills of that amount, lest they should prove bad ones;
however, as it comes from a Quaker gentleman, I suppose it is all
right.&rsquo;&nbsp; The mention of a fifty-pound note aroused the
attention of my friend, and he requested to be permitted to look
at it; he had scarcely seen it, when he was convinced that it was
one of the same description as those which had brought me into
trouble, as it corresponded with <a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>them in two particular features,
which the agent of the bank had pointed out to him and others as
evidence of their spuriousness.&nbsp; My friend, without a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation, informed the landlord that the note
was a bad one, expressing at the same time a great wish to see
the Quaker gentleman who wanted to have it changed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That you can easily do,&rsquo; said the landlord, and
forthwith conducted him into the common room, where he saw a
respectable-looking man, dressed like a Quaker, and seemingly
about sixty years of age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend, after a short apology, showed him the note
which he held in his hand, stating that he had no doubt it was a
spurious one, and begged to be informed where he had taken it,
adding, that a particular friend of his was at present in
trouble, owing to his having taken similar notes from a stranger
at Horncastle; but that he hoped that he, the Quaker, could give
information, by means of which the guilty party, or parties,
could be arrested.&nbsp; At the mention of Horncastle, it
appeared to my friend that the Quaker gave a slight start.&nbsp;
At the conclusion of this speech, however, he answered with great
tranquillity, that he had received it in the way of business at
&mdash; naming one of the principal towns in Yorkshire, from a
very respectable person, whose name he was perfectly willing to
communicate, and likewise his own, which he said was James, and
that he was a merchant residing at Liverpool; that he would write
to his friend at &mdash;, requesting him to make inquiries on the
subject; that just at that moment he was in a hurry to depart,
having some particular business at a town about ten miles off, to
go to which he had bespoken a post-chaise of the landlord; that
with respect to the note, it was doubtless a very disagreeable
thing to have a suspicious one in his possession, but that it
would make little difference to him, as he had plenty of other
money, and thereupon he pulled out a purse, containing various
other notes, and some gold, observing, &lsquo;that his only
motive for wishing to change the other note was a desire to be
well provided with change&rsquo;; and finally, that if they had
any suspicion with respect to him, he was perfectly willing to
leave the note in their possession till he should return, which
he intended to do in about a fortnight.&nbsp; There was so much
plausibility in the speech of the Quaker, and his appearance and
behaviour were so perfectly respectable, that my friend felt
almost ashamed of the suspicion which at first he had entertained
of him, though, at the same time, he felt an unaccountable
unwillingness to let the man depart without some further
interrogation.&nbsp; The landlord, however, who did not wish to
disoblige one who had been, and might probably be again, a <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>profitable
customer, declared that he was perfectly satisfied, and that he
had no wish to detain the note, which he made no doubt the
gentleman had received in the way of business, and that as the
matter concerned him alone, he would leave it to him to make the
necessary inquiries.&nbsp; &lsquo;Just as you please,
friend,&rsquo; said the Quaker, pocketing the suspicious note;
&lsquo;I will now pay my bill.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thereupon he
discharged the bill with a five-pound note, which he begged the
landlord to inspect carefully, and with two pieces of gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The landlord had just taken the money, receipted the
bill, and was bowing to his customer, when the door opened, and a
lad, dressed in a kind of grey livery, appeared, and informed the
Quaker that the chaise was ready.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is that boy your
servant?&rsquo; said the surgeon.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is,
friend,&rsquo; said the Quaker.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hast thou any reason
for asking me that question?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;And has he been
long in your service?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Several years,&rsquo;
replied the Quaker; &lsquo;I took him into my house out of
compassion, he being an orphan, but as the chaise is waiting, I
will bid thee farewell.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am afraid I must
stop your journey for the present,&rsquo; said the surgeon;
&lsquo;that boy has exactly the same blemish in the eye which a
boy had who was in company with the man at Horncastle, from whom
my friend received the forged notes, and who there passed for his
son.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I know nothing about that,&rsquo; said
the Quaker, &lsquo;but I am determined to be detained here no
longer, after the satisfactory account which I have given as to
the note&rsquo;s coming into my possession.&rsquo;&nbsp; He then
attempted to leave the room, but my friend detained him, a
struggle ensued, during which a wig which the Quaker wore fell
off, whereupon he instantly appeared to lose some twenty years of
his age.&nbsp; &lsquo;Knock the fellow down, father,&rsquo; said
the boy; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll help you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, forsooth, the pretended Quaker took the
boy&rsquo;s advice, and knocked my friend down in a
twinkling.&nbsp; The landlord, however, and waiter, seeing how
matters stood, instantly laid hold of him; but there can be no
doubt that he would have escaped from the whole three, had not
certain guests who were in the house hearing the noise, rushed
in, and helped to secure him.&nbsp; The boy was true to his word,
assisting him to the best of his ability, flinging himself
between the legs of his father&rsquo;s assailants, causing
several of them to stumble and fall.&nbsp; At length, the fellow
was secured, and led before a magistrate; the boy, to whom he was
heard to say something which nobody understood, and to whom,
after the man&rsquo;s capture, no one paid much attention, was no
more seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rest, as far as this man was concerned, may be told
in a few words; nothing to criminate him was found on his person,
but <a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>on
his baggage being examined, a quantity of spurious notes was
discovered.&nbsp; Much of his hardihood now forsook him, and in
the hope of saving his life he made some very important
disclosures; amongst other things, he confessed that it was he
who had given me the notes in exchange for the horses, and also
the note to be changed.&nbsp; He was subsequently tried on two
indictments, in the second of which I appeared against him.&nbsp;
He was condemned to die; but, in consideration of the disclosures
he had made, his sentence was commuted to perpetual
transportation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My innocence was thus perfectly established before the
eyes of the world, and all my friends hastened to congratulate
me.&nbsp; There was one who congratulated me more than all the
rest&mdash;it was my beloved one, but&mdash;but&mdash;she was
dying&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the old man drew his hand before his eyes, and remained
for some time without speaking; at length he removed his hand,
and commenced again with a broken voice: &ldquo;You will pardon
me if I hurry over this part of my story; I am unable to dwell
upon it.&nbsp; How dwell upon a period when I saw my only earthly
treasure pine away gradually day by day, and knew that nothing
could save her!&nbsp; She saw my agony, and did all she could to
console me, saying that she was herself quite resigned.&nbsp; A
little time before her death she expressed a wish that we should
be united.&nbsp; I was too happy to comply with her
request.&nbsp; We were united, I brought her to this house,
where, in less than a week, she expired in my arms.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> another pause, the old man
once more resumed his narration: &ldquo;If ever there was a man
perfectly miserable it was myself, after the loss of that
cherished woman.&nbsp; I sat solitary in the house, in which I
had hoped in her company to realise the choicest earthly
happiness, a prey to the bitterest reflections; many people
visited, and endeavoured to console me.&nbsp; Amongst them was
the clergyman of the parish, who begged me to be resigned, and
told me that it was good to be afflicted.&nbsp; I bowed my head,
but I could not help thinking how easy it must be for those who
feel no affliction to bid others to be resigned, and to talk of
the benefit resulting from sorrow; perhaps I should have paid
more attention to his discourse than I did, provided he had been
a person for whom it was possible to entertain much respect, but
his own heart was known to be set on the things of this
world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within a little time he had an opportunity, in his own
case, of practising resignation, and of realising the benefit of
being afflicted.&nbsp; A merchant, to whom he had entrusted all
his fortune, in the hope of a large interest, became suddenly a
bankrupt, with scarcely any assets.&nbsp; I will not say that it
was owing to this misfortune that the divine died in less than a
month after its occurrence, but such was the fact.&nbsp; Amongst
those who most frequently visited me was my friend the surgeon;
he did not confine himself to the common topics of consolation,
but endeavoured to impress upon me the necessity of rousing
myself, advising me to occupy my mind with some pursuit,
particularly recommending agriculture; but agriculture possessed
no interest for me, nor, indeed, any pursuit within my reach; my
hopes of happiness had been blighted, and what cared I for
anything? so at last he thought it best to leave me to myself,
hoping that time would bring with it consolation; and I remained
solitary in my house, waited upon by a male and a female
servant.&nbsp; Oh, what dreary moments I passed!&nbsp; My only
amusement&mdash;and it was a sad one&mdash;was to look at the
things which once belonged to my beloved, and which were now in
my possession.&nbsp; Oh, how fondly would I dwell upon
them!&nbsp; There were some books; I cared not for books, but
these had <a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>belonged to my beloved.&nbsp; Oh, how fondly did I
dwell on them!&nbsp; Then there was her hat and bonnet&mdash;oh,
me, how fondly did I gaze upon them! and after looking at her
things for hours, I would sit and ruminate on the happiness I had
lost.&nbsp; How I execrated the moment I had gone to the fair to
sell horses!&nbsp; &lsquo;Would that I had never been at
Horncastle to sell horses!&rsquo; I would say; &lsquo;I might at
this moment have been enjoying the company of my beloved, leading
a happy, quiet, easy life, but for that fatal expedition;&rsquo;
that thought worked on my brain, till my brain seemed to turn
round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day I sat at the breakfast-table gazing vacantly
around me; my mind was in a state of inexpressible misery; there
was a whirl in my brain, probably like that which people feel who
are rapidly going mad; this increased to such a degree that I
felt giddiness coming upon me.&nbsp; To abate this feeling I no
longer permitted my eyes to wander about, but fixed them upon an
object on the table, and continued gazing at it for several
minutes without knowing what it was; at length, the misery in my
head was somewhat stilled, my lips moved, and I heard myself
saying, &lsquo;What odd marks!&rsquo;&nbsp; I had fastened my
eyes on the side of a teapot, and by keeping them fixed upon it,
had become aware of a fact that had escaped my notice
before&mdash;namely, that there were marks upon it.&nbsp; I kept
my eyes fixed upon them, and repeated at intervals, &lsquo;What
strange marks!&rsquo; for I thought that looking upon the marks
tended to abate the whirl in my head.&nbsp; I kept tracing the
marks one after the other, and I observed that though they all
bore a general resemblance to each other, they were all to a
certain extent different.&nbsp; The smallest portion possible of
curious interest had been awakened within me, and, at last, I
asked myself, within my own mind: &lsquo;What motive could induce
people to put such odd marks on their crockery?&nbsp; They were
not pictures, they were not letters; what motive could people
have for putting them there?&rsquo;&nbsp; At last, I removed my
eyes from the teapot, and thought for a few moments about the
marks; presently, however, I felt the whirl returning; the marks
became almost effaced from my mind, and I was beginning to revert
to my miserable ruminations, when suddenly methought I heard a
voice say: &lsquo;The marks! the marks! cling to the marks!
or&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; So I fixed my eyes again upon the marks,
inspecting them more attentively, if possible, than I had done
before, and, at last, I came to the conclusion that they were not
capricious or fanciful marks, but were arranged systematically;
when I had gazed at them for a considerable time, I turned the <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>teapot
round, and on the other side I observed marks of a similar kind,
which I soon discovered were identical with the ones I had been
observing.&nbsp; All the marks were something alike, but all
somewhat different, and on comparing them with each other, I was
struck with the frequent occurrence of a mark crossing an upright
line, or projecting from it, now on the right, now on the left
side; and I said to myself: &lsquo;Why does this mark sometimes
cross the upright line, and sometimes project?&rsquo; and the
more I thought on the matter, the less did I feel of the misery
in my head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The things were at length removed, and I sat, as I had
for some time past been wont to sit after my meals, silent and
motionless; but in the present instance my mind was not entirely
abandoned to the one mournful idea which had so long distressed
it.&nbsp; It was, to a certain extent, occupied with the marks on
the teapot; it is true that the mournful idea strove hard with
the marks on the teapot for the mastery in my mind, and at last
the painful idea drove the marks of the teapot out; they,
however, would occasionally return and flit across my mind for a
moment or two, and their coming was like a momentary relief from
intense pain.&nbsp; I thought once or twice that I would have the
teapot placed before me, that I might examine the marks at
leisure, but I considered that it would be as well to defer the
re-examination of the marks till the next morning; at that time I
did not take tea of an evening.&nbsp; By deferring the
examination thus, I had something to look forward to on the next
morning.&nbsp; The day was a melancholy one, but it certainly was
more tolerable to me than any of the others had been since the
death of my beloved.&nbsp; As I lay awake that night I
occasionally thought of the marks, and in my sleep methought I
saw them upon the teapot vividly before me.&nbsp; On the morrow,
I examined the marks again; how singular they looked!&nbsp;
Surely they must mean something, and if so, what could they mean?
and at last I thought within myself whether it would be possible
for me to make out what they meant: that day I felt more relief
than on the preceding one, and towards night I walked a little
about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In about a week&rsquo;s time I received a visit from my
friend the surgeon; after a little discourse, he told me that he
perceived I was better than when he had last seen me, and asked
me what I had been about; I told him that I had been principally
occupied in considering certain marks which I had found on a
teapot, and wondering what they could mean; he smiled at first,
but instantly assuming a serious look, he asked to see the
teapot.&nbsp; I produced <a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>it, and after having surveyed the
marks with attention, he observed that they were highly curious,
and also wondered what they meant.&nbsp; &lsquo;I strongly advise
you,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;to attempt to make them out, and also
to take moderate exercise, and to see after your
concerns.&rsquo;&nbsp; I followed his advice; every morning I
studied the marks on the teapot, and in the course of the day
took moderate exercise, and attended to little domestic matters,
as became the master of a house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I subsequently learned that the surgeon, in advising me
to study the marks, and endeavour to make out their meaning,
merely hoped that by means of them my mind might by degrees be
diverted from the mournful idea on which it had so long
brooded.&nbsp; He was a man well skilled in his profession, but
had read and thought very little on matters unconnected with
it.&nbsp; He had no idea that the marks had any particular
signification, or were anything else but common and fortuitous
ones.&nbsp; That I became at all acquainted with their nature was
owing to a ludicrous circumstance which I will now relate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day, chancing to be at a neighbouring town, I was
struck with the appearance of a shop recently established.&nbsp;
It had an immense bow-window, and every part of it, to which a
brush could be applied, was painted in a gaudy flaming
style.&nbsp; Large bowls of green and black tea were placed upon
certain chests, which stood at the window.&nbsp; I stopped to
look at them, such a display, whatever it may be at the present
time, being at the period of which I am speaking, quite uncommon
in a country town.&nbsp; The tea, whether black or green, was
very shining and inviting, and the bowls, of which there were
three, standing on as many chests, were very grand and foreign
looking.&nbsp; Two of these were white, with figures and trees
painted upon them in blue; the other, which was the middlemost,
had neither trees nor figures upon it, but as I looked through
the window, appeared to have on its sides the very same kind of
marks which I had observed on the teapot at home; there were also
marks on the tea-chests, somewhat similar, but much larger, and
apparently, not executed with so much care.&nbsp; &lsquo;Best
teas direct from China,&rsquo; said a voice close to my side; and
looking round I saw a youngish man, with a frizzled head, flat
face, and an immensely wide mouth, standing in his shirt-sleeves
by the door.&nbsp; &lsquo;Direct from China,&rsquo; said he;
&lsquo;perhaps you will do me the favour to walk in and scent
them?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I do not want any tea,&rsquo; said I;
&lsquo;I was only standing at the window examining those marks on
the bowl and the chests.&nbsp; I have observed similar ones on a
teapot at home.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Pray walk in, <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>sir,&rsquo;
said the young fellow, extending his mouth till it reached nearly
from ear to ear; &lsquo;pray walk in, and I shall be happy to
give you any information respecting the manners and customs of
the Chinese in my power.&rsquo;&nbsp; Thereupon I followed him
into his shop, where he began to harangue on the manners, customs
and peculiarities of the Chinese, especially their manner of
preparing tea, not forgetting to tell me that the only genuine
Chinese tea ever imported into England was to be found in his
shop.&nbsp; &lsquo;With respect to those marks,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;on the bowl and chests, they are nothing more nor less
than Chinese writing, expressing something, though what I
can&rsquo;t exactly tell you.&nbsp; Allow me to sell you this
pound of tea,&rsquo; he added, showing me a paper parcel.&nbsp;
&lsquo;On the envelope there is a printed account of the Chinese
system of writing, extracted from authors of the most established
reputation.&nbsp; These things I print principally with the hope
of, in some degree, removing the worse than Gothic ignorance
prevalent amongst the natives of these parts.&nbsp; I am from
London myself.&nbsp; With respect to all that relates to the
Chinese real imperial tea, I assure you sir,
that&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, to make short of what you
doubtless consider a very tiresome story, I purchased the tea and
carried it home.&nbsp; The tea proved imperially bad, but the
paper envelope really contained some information on the Chinese
language and writing, amounting to about as much as you gained
from me the other day.&nbsp; On learning that the marks on the
teapot expressed words, I felt my interest with respect to them
considerably increased and returned to the task of inspecting
them with greater zeal than before, hoping, by continually
looking at them, to be able eventually to understand their
meaning, in which hope you may easily believe I was disappointed,
though my desire to understand what they represented continued on
the increase.&nbsp; In this dilemma I determined to apply again
to the shopkeeper from whom I bought the tea.&nbsp; I found him
in rather low spirits, his shirt-sleeves were soiled, and his
hair was out of curl.&nbsp; On my inquiring how he got on, he
informed me that he intended speedily to leave, having received
little or no encouragement, the people, in their Gothic
ignorance, preferring to deal with an old-fashioned shopkeeper
over the way, who, so far from possessing any acquaintance with
the polity and institutions of the Chinese, did not, he firmly
believed, know that tea came from China.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are
come for some more, I suppose?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; On receiving
an answer in the negative he looked somewhat blank, but when I
added that I came to consult with him as to the means which I
must take in order to acquire the Chinese language he brightened
up.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must get <a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>a grammar,&rsquo; said he, rubbing
his hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you not one?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he replied, &lsquo;but any bookseller can
procure you one.&rsquo;&nbsp; As I was taking my departure, he
told me that as he was about to leave the neighbourhood, the bowl
at the window, which bore the inscription, besides some other
pieces of porcelain of a similar description, were at my service,
provided I chose to purchase them.&nbsp; I consented, and two or
three days afterwards took from off his hands all the china in
his possession which bore inscriptions, paying what he
demanded.&nbsp; Had I waited till the sale of his effects, which
occurred within a few weeks, I could probably have procured it
for a fifth part of the sum which I paid, the other pieces
realising very little.&nbsp; I did not, however, grudge the poor
fellow what he got from me, as I considered myself to be somewhat
in his debt for the information he had afforded me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the rest of my story it may be briefly
told.&nbsp; I followed the advice of the shopkeeper, and applied
to a bookseller who wrote to his correspondent in London.&nbsp;
After a long interval, I was informed that if I wished to learn
Chinese I must do so through the medium of French, there being
neither Chinese grammar nor dictionary in our language.&nbsp; I
was at first very much disheartened.&nbsp; I determined, however,
at last to gratify my desire of learning Chinese, even at the
expense of learning French.&nbsp; I procured the books, and in
order to qualify myself to turn them to account, took lessons in
French from a little Swiss, the usher of a neighbouring
boarding-school.&nbsp; I was very stupid in acquiring French;
perseverance, however, enabled me to acquire a knowledge
sufficient for the object I had in view.&nbsp; In about two years
I began to study Chinese by myself, through the medium of the
French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and how did you get on with
the study of the Chinese?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the old man proceeded to inform me how he got on with
the study of Chinese, enumerated all the difficulties he had had
to encounter; dilating upon his frequent despondency of mind, and
occasionally his utter despair of ever mastering Chinese.&nbsp;
He told me that more than once he had determined upon giving up
the study, but then the misery in his head forthwith returned, to
escape from which he had as often resumed it.&nbsp; It appeared,
however, that ten years elapsed before he was able to use ten of
the two hundred and fourteen keys, which serve to undo the locks
of Chinese writing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you able at present to use the entire
number?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;I can at
present use the whole number.&nbsp; I know the key for every
particular lock, though I frequently find the wards unwilling to
give way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has nothing particular occurred to you,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;during the time that you have been prosecuting your
studies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the whole time in which I have been engaged in
these studies,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;only one
circumstance has occurred which requires any particular
mention&mdash;the death of my old friend the surgeon&mdash;who
was carried off suddenly by a fit of apoplexy.&nbsp; His death
was a great shock to me, and for a time interrupted my
studies.&nbsp; His son, however, who succeeded him, was very kind
to me, and, in some degree, supplied his father&rsquo;s place;
and I gradually returned to my Chinese locks and keys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in applying keys to the Chinese locks you employ
your time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;in making out the
inscriptions on the various pieces of porcelain, which I have at
different times procured, I pass my time.&nbsp; The first
inscription which I translated was that on the teapot of my
beloved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how many other pieces of porcelain may you have at
present in your possession?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About fifteen hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did you obtain them?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without much labour,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;in
the neighbouring towns and villages&mdash;chiefly at auctions, of
which, about twenty years ago, there were many in these
parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And may I ask your reasons for confining your studies
entirely to the crockery literature of China, when you have all
the rest at your disposal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The inscriptions enable me to pass my time,&rdquo; said
the old man; &ldquo;what more would the whole literature of China
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And from those inscriptions,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what
a book it is in your power to make, whenever so disposed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Translations from the crockery literature of
China.&rsquo;&nbsp; Such a book would be sure to take; even
glorious John himself would not disdain to publish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have no desire for literary
distinction,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;no ambition.&nbsp; My
original wish was to pass my life in easy, quiet obscurity, with
her whom I loved.&nbsp; I was disappointed in my wish; she was
removed, who constituted my only felicity in this life;
desolation came to my heart, and misery to my head.&nbsp; To
escape from the latter I had recourse to Chinese.&nbsp; By
degrees the misery left my head, but the desolation of the heart
yet remains.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>&ldquo;Be of good cheer,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;through
the instrumentality of this affliction you have learnt Chinese,
and, in so doing, learnt to practice the duties of
hospitality.&nbsp; Who but a man who could read Runes on a
teapot, would have received an unfortunate wayfarer as you have
received me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;let us hope that
all is for the best.&nbsp; I am by nature indolent, and, but for
this affliction, should, perhaps, have hardly taken the trouble
to do my duty to my fellow-creatures.&nbsp; I am very, very
indolent,&rdquo; said he, slightly glancing towards the clock;
&ldquo;therefore let us hope that all is for the best; but, oh!
these trials, they are very hard to bear.&rdquo;</p>

209</span>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning, having
breakfasted with my old friend, I went into the stable to make
the necessary preparations for my departure; there, with the
assistance of a stable lad, I cleaned and caparisoned my horse,
and then, returning into the house, I made the old female
attendant such a present as I deemed would be some compensation
for the trouble I had caused.&nbsp; Hearing that the old
gentleman was in his study, I repaired to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
come to take leave of you,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and to thank you
for all the hospitality which I have received at your
hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; The eyes of the old man were fixed
steadfastly on the inscription which I had found him studying on
a former occasion.&nbsp; &ldquo;At length,&rdquo; he murmured to
himself, &ldquo;I have it&mdash;I think I have it;&rdquo; and
then, looking at me, he said: &ldquo;So you are about to
depart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;my horse will be at the
front door in a few minutes; I am glad, however, before I go, to
find that you have mastered the inscription.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;I believe I have
mastered it; it seems to consist of some verses relating to the
worship of the Spirit of the Hearth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the Spirit of the Hearth?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the many demons which the Chinese
worship,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;they do not worship one
God, but many.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then the old man told me a great
many highly interesting particulars respecting the demon worship
of the Chinese.</p>
<p>After the lapse of at least half an hour I said: &ldquo;I must
not linger here any longer, however willing.&nbsp; Horncastle is
distant, and I wish to be there to-night.&nbsp; Pray can you
inform me what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man, rising, looked towards the clock which hung on
the side of the room at his left hand, on the farther side of the
table at which he was seated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am rather short-sighted,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and
cannot distinguish the numbers at that distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is ten o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said the old man;
&ldquo;I believe somewhat past.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>&ldquo;A quarter, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;a quarter
or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven minutes, or ten minutes past ten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, to tell you the truth,&rdquo; said the old man
with a smile, &ldquo;there is one thing to the knowledge of which
I could never exactly attain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that you do
not know what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can give a guess,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;to
within a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you cannot tell the exact moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of wonder,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;with that
thing there on the wall continually ticking in your ear, how
comes it that you do not know what&rsquo;s
o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;I have contented
myself with giving a tolerably good guess; to do more would have
been too great trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have learnt Chinese,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;I have learnt
Chinese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I really would counsel you
to learn to know what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock as soon as
possible.&nbsp; Consider what a sad thing it would be to go out
of the world not knowing what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; A
millionth part of the trouble required to learn Chinese would, if
employed, infallibly teach you to know what&rsquo;s
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a motive for learning Chinese,&rdquo; said the
old man; &ldquo;the hope of appeasing the misery in my
head.&nbsp; With respect to not knowing what&rsquo;s
o&rsquo;clock, I cannot see anything particularly sad in the
matter.&nbsp; A man may get through the world very creditably
without knowing what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Yet, upon the
whole, it is no bad thing to know what&rsquo;s
o&rsquo;clock&mdash;you, of course, do.&nbsp; It would be too
good a joke if two people were to be together, one knowing
Armenian and the other Chinese, and neither knowing what&rsquo;s
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll now see you off.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Leaving</span> the house of the old man
who knew Chinese, but could not tell what was o&rsquo;clock, I
wended my way to Horncastle, which I reached in the evening of
the same day, without having met any adventure on the way worthy
of being marked down in this very remarkable history.</p>
<p>The town was a small one, seemingly ancient, and was crowded
with people and horses.&nbsp; I proceeded, without delay, to the
inn to which my friend the surgeon had directed me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is of no use coming here,&rdquo; said two or three
ostlers, as I entered the yard&mdash;&ldquo;all full&mdash;no
room whatever&rdquo;; whilst one added in an undertone,
&ldquo;That ere a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a bad-looking
horse&rdquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to see the master of this
inn,&rdquo; said I, as I dismounted from the horse.&nbsp;
&ldquo;See the master,&rdquo; said an ostler&mdash;the same who
had paid the negative kind of compliment to the
horse&mdash;&ldquo;a likely thing, truly; my master is drinking
wine with some of the grand gentry, and can&rsquo;t be disturbed
for the sake of the like of you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I bring a
letter to him,&rdquo; said I, pulling out the surgeon&rsquo;s
epistle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish you would deliver it to him,&rdquo;
I added, offering a half-crown.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you,
is it?&rdquo; said the ostler, taking the letter and the
half-crown; &ldquo;my master will be right glad to see you; why,
you ha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t been here for many a year; I&rsquo;ll
carry the note to him at once.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with these words
he hurried into the house.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nice
horse, young man,&rdquo; said another ostler; &ldquo;what will
you take for it?&rdquo; to which interrogation I made no
answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you wish to sell him,&rdquo; said the
ostler, coming up to me, and winking knowingly, &ldquo;I think I
and my partners might offer you a summut under seventy
pounds,&rdquo; to which kind of half-insinuated offer I made no
reply, save by winking in the same kind of knowing manner in
which I had observed him wink.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rather leary!&rdquo;
said a third ostler.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, young man, perhaps you
will drink to-night with me and my partners, when we can talk the
matter over.&rdquo;&nbsp; Before I had time to answer, the
landlord, a well-dressed, good-looking man, made his appearance
with the ostler; he bore the letter in his hand.&nbsp; Without
glancing at me, he betook himself <a name="page212"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>at once to consider the horse, going
round him and observing every point with the utmost
minuteness.&nbsp; At last, after having gone round the horse
three times, he stopped beside me, and keeping his eyes on the
horse, bent his head towards his right shoulder.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That horse is worth some money,&rdquo; said he, turning
towards me suddenly, and slightly touching me on the arm with the
letter which he held in his hand; to which observation I made no
reply, save by bending my head towards the right shoulder as I
had seen him do.&nbsp; &ldquo;The young man is going to talk to
me and my partners about it to-night,&rdquo; said the ostler who
had expressed an opinion that he and his friends might offer me
somewhat under seventy pounds for the animal.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;the young man knows
what he is about; in the meantime, lead the horse to the reserved
stall, and see well after him.&nbsp; My friend,&rdquo; said he,
taking me aside after the ostler had led the animal away,
&ldquo;recommends you to me in the strongest manner, on which
account alone I take you and your horse in.&nbsp; I need not
advise you not to be taken in, as I should say, by your look,
that you are tolerably awake; but there are queer hands at
Horncastle at this time, and those fellows of mine, you
understand me&mdash;; but I have a great deal to do at present,
so you must excuse me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And thereupon went into the
house.</p>
<p>That same evening I was engaged at least two hours in the
stable, in rubbing the horse down, and preparing him for the
exhibition which I intended he should make in the fair on the
following day.&nbsp; The ostler to whom I had given the
half-crown occasionally assisted me, though he was too much
occupied by the horses of other guests to devote any length of
time to the service of mine; he more than once repeated to me his
firm conviction that himself and partners could afford to offer
me summut for the horse; and at a later hour when, in compliance
with his invitation, I took a glass of summut with himself and
partners, in a little room surrounded with corn-chests, on which
we sat, both himself and partners endeavoured to impress upon me,
chiefly by means of nods and winks, their conviction that they
could afford to give me summut for the horse, provided I were
disposed to sell him; in return for which intimation, with as
many nods and winks as they had all collectively used, I
endeavoured to impress upon them my conviction that I could get
summut handsomer in the fair than they might be disposed to offer
me, seeing as how&mdash;which how I followed by a wink and a nod,
which they seemed perfectly to understand, one or two of them
declaring that if the case was so it made a great deal of
difference, and that they did not wish <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>to be any
hindrance to me, more particularly as it was quite clear I had
been an ostler like themselves.</p>
<p>It was late at night when I began to think of retiring to
rest.&nbsp; On inquiring if there was any place in which I could
sleep, I was informed that there was a bed at my service,
provided I chose to sleep in a two-bedded room, one of the beds
of which was engaged by another gentleman.&nbsp; I expressed my
satisfaction at this arrangement, and was conducted by a
maid-servant up many pairs of stairs to a garret, in which were
two small beds, in one of which she gave me to understand another
gentleman slept; he had, however, not yet retired to rest; I
asked who he was, but the maid-servant could give me no
information about him, save that he was a highly respectable
gentleman, and a friend of her master&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Presently,
bidding me good-night, she left me with a candle; and I, having
undressed myself and extinguished the light, went to bed.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the noises which sounded from every part of the
house, I was not slow in falling asleep, being thoroughly
tired.&nbsp; I know not how long I might have been in bed,
perhaps two hours, when I was partially awakened by a light
shining upon my face, whereupon, unclosing my eyes, I perceived
the figure of a man, with a candle in one hand, staring at my
face, whilst with the other hand, he held back the curtain of the
bed.&nbsp; As I have said before, I was only partially awakened,
my power of conception was consequently very confused; it
appeared to me, however, that the man was dressed in a green
coat; that he had curly brown or black hair, and that there was
something peculiar in his look.&nbsp; Just as I was beginning to
recollect myself, the curtain dropped, and I heard, or thought I
heard, a voice say: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know the
cove&rdquo;.&nbsp; Then there was a rustling like a person
undressing, whereupon being satisfied that it was my
fellow-lodger, I dropped asleep, but was awakened again by a kind
of heavy plunge upon the other bed, which caused it to rock and
creak, when I observed that the light had been extinguished,
probably blown out, if I might judge from a rather disagreeable
smell of burnt wick which remained in the room, and which kept me
awake till I heard my companion breathing hard, when, turning on
the other side, I was again once more speedily in the arms of
slumber.</p>
<h2><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> had been my intention to be up
and doing early on the following morning, but my slumbers proved
so profound, that I did not wake until about eight; on arising, I
again found myself the sole occupant of the apartment, my more
alert companion having probably risen at a much earlier
hour.&nbsp; Having dressed myself, I descended, and going to the
stable, found my horse under the hands of my friend the ostler,
who was carefully rubbing him down.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a better horse in the fair,&rdquo; said he to
me, &ldquo;and as you are one of us, and appear to be all right,
I&rsquo;ll give you a piece of advice&mdash;don&rsquo;t take less
than a hundred and fifty for him; if you mind your hits, you may
get it, for I have known two hundred given in this fair for one
no better, if so good.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;thank you for your advice, which I will take, and if
successful, will give you &lsquo;summut&rsquo;
handsome.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the ostler;
&ldquo;and now let me ask whether you are up to all the ways of
this here place?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have never been here
before,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I have a pair of tolerably
sharp eyes in my head.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That I see you
have,&rdquo; said the ostler, &ldquo;but many a body, with as
sharp a pair of eyes as yourn, has lost his horse in this fair,
for want of having been here before, therefore,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a caution or two.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Thereupon the ostler proceeded to give me at least half a dozen
cautions, only two of which I shall relate to the reader: the
first, not to stop to listen to what any chance customer might
have to say; and the last&mdash;the one on which he appeared to
lay most stress&mdash;by no manner of means to permit a
Yorkshireman to get up into the saddle, &ldquo;for,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;if you do, it is three to one that he rides off with
the horse; he can&rsquo;t help it; trust a cat amongst cream, but
never trust a Yorkshireman on the saddle of a good horse;
by-the-bye,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that saddle of yours is
not a particularly good one, no more is the bridle.&nbsp; A
shabby saddle and bridle have more than once spoiled the sale of
a good horse.&nbsp; I tell you what, as you seem a decent kind of
a young chap, I&rsquo;ll lend you a saddle and bridle of my
master&rsquo;s, almost bran new; he won&rsquo;t object, I know,
as you are a friend of his, only you must not forget your promise
to <a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>come
down with &lsquo;summut handsome&rsquo; after you have sold the
animal.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>After a slight breakfast I mounted the horse, which, decked
out in his borrowed finery, really looked better by a large sum
of money than on any former occasion.&nbsp; Making my way out of
the yard of the inn, I was instantly in the principal street of
the town, up and down which an immense number of horses were
being exhibited, some led, and others with riders.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
wonderful small quantity of good horses in the fair this
time!&rdquo; I heard a stout, jockey-looking individual say, who
was staring up the street with his side towards me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Halloo, young fellow!&rdquo; said he, a few moments after
I had passed, &ldquo;whose horse is that?&nbsp; Stop!&nbsp; I
want to look at him!&rdquo;&nbsp; Though confident that he was
addressing himself to me, I took no notice, remembering the
advice of the ostler, and proceeded up the street.&nbsp; My horse
possessed a good walking step; but walking, as the reader knows,
was not his best pace, which was the long trot, at which I could
not well exercise him in the street, on account of the crowd of
men and animals; however, as he walked along, I could easily
perceive that he attracted no slight attention amongst those, who
by their jockey dress and general appearance, I imagined to be
connoisseurs; I heard various calls to stop, to none of which I
paid the slightest attention.&nbsp; In a few minutes I found
myself out of the town, when, turning round for the purpose of
returning, I found I had been followed by several of the
connoisseur-looking individuals, whom I had observed in the
fair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now would be the time for a display,&rdquo;
thought I; and looking around me I observed two five-barred
gates, one on each side of the road, and fronting each
other.&nbsp; Turning my horse&rsquo;s head to one, I pressed my
heels to his sides, loosened the reins, and gave an encouraging
cry, whereupon the animal cleared the gate in a twinkling.&nbsp;
Before he had advanced ten yards in the field to which the gate
opened, I had turned him round, and again giving him cry and
rein, I caused him to leap back again into the road, and still
allowing him head, I made him leap the other gate; and forthwith
turning him round, I caused him to leap once more into the road,
where he stood proudly tossing his head, as much as to say,
&ldquo;What more?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A fine horse! a capital
horse!&rdquo; said several of the connoisseurs.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
do you ask for him?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Too much for any of you
to pay,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;A horse like this is intended
for other kind of customers than any of you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;How do you know that,&rdquo; said one; the very same
person whom I had heard complaining in the street of the paucity
of good horses in the fair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, let us know <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>what you
ask for him?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A hundred and fifty
pounds,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;neither more nor less.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you call that a great price?&rdquo; said the man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, I thought you would have asked double that
amount!&nbsp; You do yourself injustice, young man.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Perhaps I do,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s my
affair; I do not choose to take more.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish
you would let me get into the saddle,&rdquo; said the man;
&ldquo;the horse knows you, and therefore shows to more
advantage; but I should like to see how he would move under me,
who am a stranger.&nbsp; Will you let me get into the saddle,
young man?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I will
not let you get into the saddle.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
not?&rdquo; said the man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lest you should be a
Yorkshireman,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and should run away with the
horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yorkshire?&rdquo; said the man;
&ldquo;I am from Suffolk, silly Suffolk, so you need not be
afraid of my running away with the horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!
if that&rsquo;s the case,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I should be
afraid that the horse would run away with you; so I will by no
means let you mount.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you let me look in
his mouth?&rdquo; said the man.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you
please,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but I tell you, he&rsquo;s apt to
bite.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He can scarcely be a worse bite than
his master,&rdquo; said the man, looking into the horse&rsquo;s
mouth; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s four off.&nbsp; I say, young man, will
you warrant this horse?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;I never warrant horses; the horses that I ride can always
warrant themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish you would let me
speak a word to you,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just come
aside.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a nice horse,&rdquo; said he in a
half-whisper, after I had ridden a few paces aside with
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nice horse,&rdquo; said he,
placing his hand upon the pommel of the saddle, and looking up in
my face, &ldquo;and I think I can find you a customer.&nbsp; If
you would take a hundred, I think my lord would purchase it, for
he has sent me about the fair to look him up a horse, by which he
could hope to make an honest penny.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and could he not make an
honest penny, and yet give me the price I ask?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the go-between, &ldquo;a hundred and
fifty pounds is as much as the animal is worth, or nearly so; and
my lord, do you see&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I see no reason at
all,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;why I should sell the animal for less
than he is worth, in order that his lordship may be benefited by
him; so that if his lordship wants to make an honest penny, he
must find some person who would consider the disadvantage of
selling him a horse for less than it is worth as counterbalanced
by the honour of dealing with a lord, which I should never do;
but I can&rsquo;t be wasting my time here.&nbsp; I am going back
to the &mdash;, where, if you, or any person, are desirous of
purchasing the horse, you must come within the next half-hour, or
I shall probably not feel disposed to sell him at
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Another <a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>word, young man,&rdquo; said the
jockey, but without staying to hear what he had to say, I put the
horse to his best trot, and re-entering the town, and threading
my way as well as I could through the press, I returned to the
yard of the inn, where, dismounting, I stood still, holding the
horse by the bridle.</p>
<p>I had been standing in this manner about five minutes, when I
saw the jockey enter the yard, accompanied by another
individual.&nbsp; They advanced directly towards me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here is my lord come to look at the horse, young
man,&rdquo; said the jockey.&nbsp; My lord, as the jockey called
him, was a tall figure, of about five-and-thirty.&nbsp; He had on
his head a hat somewhat rusty, and on his back a surtout of blue
rather the worse for wear.&nbsp; His forehead, if not high, was
exceedingly narrow; his eyes were brown, with a rat-like glare in
them; the nose was rather long, and the mouth very wide; the
cheek-bones high, and the cheeks, as to hue and consistency,
exhibiting very much the appearance of a withered red apple;
there was a gaunt expression of hunger in the whole
countenance.&nbsp; He had scarcely glanced at the horse; when
drawing in his cheeks, he thrust out his lips very much after the
manner of a baboon when he sees a piece of sugar held out towards
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is this horse yours?&rdquo; said he, suddenly
turning towards me, with a kind of smirk.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
my horse,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;are you the person who wishes to
make an honest penny by it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How!&rdquo; said
he, drawing up his head with a very consequential look, and
speaking with a very haughty tone; &ldquo;what do you
mean?&rdquo;&nbsp; We looked at each other full in the face;
after a few moments, the muscles of the mouth of him of the
hungry look began to move violently, the face was puckered into
innumerable wrinkles, and the eyes became half-closed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;have you ever seen me
before?&nbsp; I suppose you are asking yourself that
question.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Excuse me, sir,&rdquo; said he,
dropping his lofty look, and speaking in a very subdued and civil
tone, &ldquo;I have never had the honour of seeing you before,
that is&mdash;&rdquo; said he, slightly glancing at me again, and
again moving the muscles of his mouth; &ldquo;no, I have never
seen you before,&rdquo; he added, making me a bow, &ldquo;I have
never had that pleasure.&nbsp; My business with you, at present,
is to inquire the lowest price you are willing to take for this
horse.&nbsp; My agent here informs me that you ask one hundred
and fifty pounds, which I cannot think of giving.&nbsp; The horse
is a showy horse, but look, my dear sir, he has a defect here,
and there in his near fore leg I observe something which looks
very like a splint&mdash;yes, upon my credit,&rdquo; said he,
touching the animal, &ldquo;he has a splint, or something which
will end in one.&nbsp; A hundred and fifty pounds, sir! what <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>could have
induced you ever to ask anything like that for this animal?&nbsp;
I protest that, in my time, I have frequently bought a better
for&mdash;&nbsp; Who are you, sir?&nbsp; I am in treaty for this
horse,&rdquo; said he to a man who had come up whilst he was
talking, and was now looking into the horse&rsquo;s mouth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo; said the man, still looking into the
horse&rsquo;s mouth; &ldquo;who am I? his lordship asks me.&nbsp;
Ah, I see, close on five,&rdquo; said he, releasing the
horse&rsquo;s jaws, and looking at me.&nbsp; This new comer was a
thin, wiry-made individual, with wiry curling brown hair; his
face was dark, and wore an arch and somewhat roguish expression;
upon one of his eyes was a kind of speck or beam; he might be
about forty, wore a green jockey coat, and held in his hand a
black riding-whip, with a knob of silver wire.&nbsp; As I gazed
upon his countenance, it brought powerfully to my mind the face
which, by the light of the candle, I had seen staring over me on
the preceding night, when lying in bed and half-asleep.&nbsp;
Close beside him, and seemingly in his company, stood an
exceedingly tall figure, that of a youth, seemingly about
one-and-twenty, dressed in a handsome riding-dress, and wearing
on his head a singular hat, green in colour, and with a very high
peak.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you ask for this horse?&rdquo; said he
of the green coat, winking at me with the eye which had a beam in
it, whilst the other shone and sparkled like Mrs. Colonel
W&mdash;&rsquo;s Golconda diamond.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who are you, sir,
I demand once more?&rdquo; said he of the hungry look.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who am I? why, who should I be but Jack Dale, who buys
horses for himself and other folk; I want one at present for this
short young gentleman,&rdquo; said he, motioning with his finger
to the gigantic youth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said the
other, &ldquo;and what business have you to interfere between me
and any purchase I may be disposed to make?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;be quick and
purchase the horse, or, perhaps, I may.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
you think I am to be dictated to by a fellow of your
description?&rdquo; said his lordship; &ldquo;begone,
or&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you ask for this
horse?&rdquo; said the other to me, very coolly.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
hundred and fifty,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t
mind giving it to you,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will do
no such thing,&rdquo; said his lordship, speaking so fast that he
almost stuttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he to me,
&ldquo;I must give you what you ask; Symmonds, take possession of
the animal for me,&rdquo; said he to the other jockey who
attended him.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will please to do no such thing
without my consent,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I have not sold
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have this moment told you that I will
give you the price you demand,&rdquo; said his lordship;
&ldquo;is not that sufficient?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;there is a proper manner of doing everything; had
you come forward in <a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>a manly and gentlemanly manner to
purchase the horse, I should have been happy to sell him to you,
but after all the fault you have found with him, I would not sell
him to you at any price, so send your friend to find up
another.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You behave in this manner, I
suppose,&rdquo; said his lordship, &ldquo;because this fellow has
expressed a willingness to come to your terms.&nbsp; I would
advise you to be cautious how you trust the animal in his hands;
I think I have seen him before and could tell
you&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What can you tell of me?&rdquo;
said the other, going up to him; &ldquo;except that I have been a
poor dicky-boy, and that now I am a dealer in horses, and that my
father was lagged; that&rsquo;s all you could tell of me, and
that I don&rsquo;t mind telling myself: but there are two things
they can&rsquo;t say of me, they can&rsquo;t say that I am either
a coward or a screw either, except so far as one who gets his
bread by horses may be expected to be; and they can&rsquo;t say
of me that I ever ate up an ice which a young woman was waiting
for, or that I ever backed out of a fight.&nbsp; Horse!&rdquo;
said he, motioning with his finger tauntingly to the other,
&ldquo;what do you want with a horse, except to take the bread
out of the mouth of a poor man&mdash;to-morrow is not the battle
of Waterloo, so that you don&rsquo;t want to back out of danger,
by pretending to have hurt yourself by falling from the
creature&rsquo;s back, my lord of the white feather; come, none
of your fierce looks, I am not afraid of you.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
fact, the other had assumed an expression of the deadliest
malice, his teeth were clenched, his lips quivered, and were
quite pale; the rat-like eyes sparkled, and he made a
half-spring, <i>&agrave; la rat</i>, towards his adversary, who
only laughed.&nbsp; Restraining himself, however, he suddenly
turned to his understrapper, saying: &ldquo;Symmonds, will you
see me thus insulted? go and trounce this scoundrel; you can, I
know.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Symmonds trounce me!&rdquo; said the
other, going up to the person addressed, and drawing his hand
contemptuously over his face; &ldquo;why, I beat Symmonds in this
very yard in one round three years ago; didn&rsquo;t I,
Symmonds?&rdquo; said he to the understrapper, who held down his
head, muttering, in a surly tone, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come here
to fight; let every one take his own part.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Symmonds,&rdquo; said the other,
&ldquo;especially every one from whom there is nothing to be
got.&nbsp; I would give you half a crown for all the trouble you
have had, provided I were not afraid that my Lord Plume there
would get it from you as soon as you leave the yard
together.&nbsp; Come, take yourselves both off; there&rsquo;s
nothing to be made here.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed, his lordship seemed
to be of the same opinion, for after a further glance at the
horse, a contemptuous look at me, and a scowl at <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>the jockey,
he turned on his heel, muttering something which sounded like
fellows, and stalked out of the yard, followed by Symmonds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, young man,&rdquo; said the jockey, or whatever
he was, turning to me with an arch leer, &ldquo;I suppose I may
consider myself as the purchaser of this here animal, for the use
and behoof of this young gentleman?&rdquo; making a sign with his
head towards the tall young man by his side.&nbsp; &ldquo;By no
means,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I am utterly unacquainted with
either of you, and before parting with the horse, I must be
satisfied as to the respectability of the purchaser.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh! as to that matter,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have
plenty of vouchers for my respectability about me,&rdquo; and
thrusting his hand into his bosom below his waistcoat, he drew
out a large bundle of notes.&nbsp; &ldquo;These are the kind of
things,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;which vouch best for a man&rsquo;s
respectability.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not always,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;indeed, sometimes these kind of things need vouchers for
themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man looked at me with a peculiar
look.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean to say that these notes are not
sufficient notes?&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;because if you do, I
shall take the liberty of thinking that you are not over civil,
and when I thinks a person is not over and above civil I
sometimes takes off my coat, and when my coat is
off&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You sometimes knock people
down,&rdquo; I added; &ldquo;well, whether you knock me down or
not, I beg leave to tell you that I am a stranger in this fair,
and that I shall part with the horse to nobody who has no better
guarantee for his respectability than a roll of bank-notes, which
may be good or not for what I know, who am not a judge of such
things.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! if you are a stranger
here,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;as I believe you are, never
having seen you here before except last night, when I think I saw
you above stairs by the glimmer of a candle&mdash;I say, if you
are a stranger, you are quite right to be cautious; queer things
being done in this fair, as nobody knows better than
myself,&rdquo; he added with a leer; &ldquo;but I suppose if the
landlord of the house vouches for me and my notes, you will have
no objection to part with the horse to me?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and in the meantime
the horse can return to the stable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon I delivered the horse to my friend the ostler.&nbsp;
The landlord of the house on being questioned by me as to the
character and condition of my new acquaintance, informed me that
he was a respectable horsedealer, and an intimate friend of his,
whereupon the purchase was soon brought to a satisfactory
conclusion.</p>

221</span>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was evening, and myself and the
two acquaintances I had made in the fair&mdash;namely, the jockey
and the tall foreigner&mdash;sat in a large upstairs room, which
looked into a court; we had dined with several people connected
with the fair at a long <i>table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i>; they had
now departed, and we sat at a small side-table with wine and a
candle before us; both my companions had pipes in their
mouths&mdash;the jockey a common pipe, and the foreigner one, the
syphon of which, made of some kind of wood, was at least six feet
long, and the bowl of which, made of a white kind of substance
like porcelain, and capable of holding nearly an ounce of
tobacco, rested on the ground.&nbsp; The jockey frequently
emptied and replenished his glass; the foreigner sometimes raised
his to his lips, for no other purpose seemingly than to moisten
them, as he never drained his glass.&nbsp; As for myself, though
I did not smoke, I had a glass before me, from which I sometimes
took a sip.&nbsp; The room, notwithstanding the window was flung
open, was in general so filled with smoke, chiefly that which was
drawn from the huge bowl of the foreigner, that my companions and
I were frequently concealed from each other&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp;
The conversation, which related entirely to the events of the
fair, was carried on by the jockey and myself, the foreigner, who
appeared to understand the greater part of what we said,
occasionally putting in a few observations in broken
English.&nbsp; At length the jockey, after the other had made
some ineffectual attempts to express something intelligibly which
he wished to say, observed: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a pity that so
fine a fellow as meinheer, and so clever a fellow too, as I
believe him to be, is not a little better master of our
language?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the gentleman a German?&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;if so,
I can interpret for him anything he wishes to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deuce you can,&rdquo; said the jockey, taking his
pipe out of his mouth, and staring at me through the smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! you speak German,&rdquo; vociferated the foreigner
in that language.&nbsp; &ldquo;By Isten, I am glad of it!&nbsp; I
wanted to say&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; And here he said in German what
he wished to say, and which was of no great importance, and which
I translated into English.</p>
<p><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>&ldquo;Well, if you don&rsquo;t put me out,&rdquo; said
the jockey; &ldquo;what language is that&mdash;Dutch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;High Dutch,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;High Dutch, and you speak High Dutch,&mdash;why I had
booked you for as great an ignoramus as myself, who can&rsquo;t
write&mdash;no, nor distinguish in a book a great A from a
bull&rsquo;s foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A person may be a very clever man,&rdquo; said
I&mdash;&ldquo;no, not a clever man, for clever signifies
clerkly, and a clever man one who is able to read and write, and
entitled to the benefit of his clergy or clerkship; but a person
may be a very acute person without being able to read or
write.&nbsp; I never saw a more acute countenance than your
own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No soft soap,&rdquo; said the jockey, &ldquo;for I
never uses any.&nbsp; However, thank you for your information; I
have hitherto thought myself a &rsquo;nition clever fellow, but
from henceforth shall consider myself just the contrary, and
only&mdash;what&rsquo;s the word?&mdash;confounded
&rsquo;cute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the jockey, &ldquo;as you say you can
speak High Dutch, I should like to hear you and master six foot
six fire away at each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot speak German,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but I can
understand tolerably well what others say in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, no backing out,&rdquo; said the jockey;
&ldquo;let&rsquo;s hear you fire away for the glory of Old
England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are a German?&rdquo; said I in German to the
foreigner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said the jockey, &ldquo;keep it
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A German!&rdquo; said the tall foreigner.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, I thank God that I do not belong to the stupid,
sluggish Germanic race, but to a braver, taller and handsomer
people;&rdquo; here taking the pipe out of his mouth, he stood up
proudly erect, so that his head nearly touched the ceiling of the
room, then reseating himself, and again putting the syphon to his
lips, he added, &ldquo;I am a Magyar&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>The foreigner looked at me for a moment somewhat
contemptuously, through the smoke, then said, in a voice of
thunder, &ldquo;A Hungarian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a voice the chap has when he pleases!&rdquo;
interposed the jockey; &ldquo;what is he saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merely that he is a Hungarian,&rdquo; said I; but I
added, &ldquo;the conversation of this gentleman and myself in a
language which you can&rsquo;t understand must be very tedious to
you, we had better give it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep on with it,&rdquo; said the jockey; &ldquo;I shall
go on listening very contentedly till I fall asleep, no bad thing
to do at most times.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Then</span> you are a countryman of
Tekeli, and of the queen who made the celebrated water,&rdquo;
said I, speaking to the Hungarian in German, which I was able to
do tolerably well owing to my having translated the
publisher&rsquo;s philosophy into that language, always provided
I did not attempt to say much at a time.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Ah! you have heard of Tekeli, and of
L&rsquo;eau de la Reine d&rsquo;Hongrie.&nbsp; How is that?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I have seen a play acted, founded on the
exploits of Tekeli, and have read Pigault Le Brun&rsquo;s
beautiful romance, entitled the <i>Barons of Felsheim</i> in
which he is mentioned.&nbsp; As for the water, I have heard a
lady, the wife of a master of mine, speak of it.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Was she handsome?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Very.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Did she possess the water?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I should say not; for I have heard her
express a great curiosity about it.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Was she growing old?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Of course not, but why do you put all
these questions?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Because the water is said to make
people handsome, and above all, to restore to the aged the beauty
of their youth.&nbsp; Well! Tekeli was my countryman, and I have
the honour of having some of the blood of the Tekelis in my
veins, but with respect to the queen, pardon me if I tell you
that she was not an Hungarian; she was a Pole&mdash;Ersebet by
name, daughter of Wladislaus Locticus King of Poland; she was the
fourth spouse of Caroly the Second, King of the Magyar country,
who married her in 1320.&nbsp; She was a great woman and
celebrated politician, though at present chiefly known by her
water.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; How came she to invent it?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; If her own account may be believed,
she did not invent it.&nbsp; After her death, as I have read in
Florentius of Buda, there was found a statement of the manner in
which she came by it written in her own hand, on a fly-leaf of
her breviary, to the <a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>following effect: Being afflicted
with a grievous disorder at the age of seventy-two, she received
the medicine which was called her water, from an old hermit whom
she never saw before or afterwards; it not only cured her, but
restored to her all her former beauty, so that the King of Poland
fell in love with her, and made her an offer of marriage, which
she refused for the glory of God, from whose holy angel she
believed she had received the water.&nbsp; The receipt for making
it and directions for using it, were also found on the
fly-leaf.&nbsp; The principal component parts were burnt wine and
rosemary, passed through an alembic; a drachm of it was to be
taken once a week, &ldquo;<i>etelbenn vagy italbann</i>,&rdquo;
in the food or the drink, early in the morning, and the cheeks
were to be moistened with it every day.&nbsp; The effects,
according to the statement, were wonderful&mdash;and perhaps they
were upon the queen; but whether the water has been equally
efficacious on other people, is a point which I cannot
determine.&nbsp; I should wish to see some old woman who has been
restored to youthful beauty by the use of L&rsquo;eau de la Reine
d&rsquo;Hongrie.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Perhaps, if you did, the old gentlewoman
would hardly be so ingenuous as the queen.&nbsp; But who are the
Hungarians&mdash;descendants of Attila and his people?</p>
<p>The Hungarian shook his head, and gave me to understand that
he did not believe that his nation were the descendants of Attila
and his people, though he acknowledged that they were probably of
the same race.&nbsp; Attila and his armies, he said, came and
disappeared in a very mysterious manner, and that nothing could
be said with positiveness about them; that the people now known
as Magyars first made their appearance in Muscovy in the year
884, under the leadership of Almus, called so from <i>alom</i>,
which, in the Hungarian language, signifies a dream; his mother,
before his birth, having dreamt that the child with which she was
<i>enceinte</i> would be the father of a long succession of
kings, which, in fact, was the case; that after beating the
Russians he entered Hungary, and coming to a place called Ungvar,
from which many people believed that modern Hungary derived its
name, he captured it, and held in it a grand festival, which
lasted four days, at the end of which time he resigned the
leadership of the Magyars to his son Arpad.&nbsp; This Arpad and
his Magyars utterly subdued Pannonia&mdash;that is, Hungary and
Transylvania&mdash;wresting the government of it from the
Sclavonian tribes who inhabited it, and settling down amongst
them as conquerors!&nbsp; After giving me this information, the
Hungarian exclaimed with much animation: &ldquo;A goodly country
that which they had entered on, consisting of <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>a plain
surrounded by mountains, some of which intersect it here and
there, with noble rapid rivers, the grandest of which is the
mighty Dunau; a country with tiny volcanoes, casting up puffs of
smoke and steam, and from which hot springs arise, good for the
sick; with many fountains, some of which are so pleasant to the
taste as to be preferred to wine; with a generous soil which,
warmed by a beautiful sun, is able to produce corn, grapes, and
even the Indian weed; in fact, one of the finest countries in the
world, which even a Spaniard would pronounce to be nearly equal
to Spain.&nbsp; Here they rested, meditating, however, fresh
conquests.&nbsp; Oh, the Magyars soon showed themselves a mighty
people.&nbsp; Besides Hungary and Transylvania, they subdued
Bulgaria and Bosnia, and the land of Tot, now called
Sclavonia.&nbsp; The generals of Zoltan, the son of Arpad, led
troops of horsemen to the banks of the Rhine.&nbsp; One of them,
at the head of a host, besieged Constantinople.&nbsp; It was then
that Botond engaged in combat with a Greek of gigantic stature,
who came out of the city and challenged the two best men in the
Magyar army.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am the feeblest of the
Magyars,&rsquo; said Botond, &lsquo;but I will kill thee;&rsquo;
and he performed his word, having previously given a proof of the
feebleness of his arm by striking his battle-axe through the
brazen gate, making a hole so big that a child of five years old
could walk through it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Of what religion were the old
Hungarians?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; They had some idea of a Supreme Being,
whom they called <i>Isten</i>, which word is still used by the
Magyars for God; but their chief devotion was directed to
sorcerers and soothsayers, something like the Schamans of the
Siberian steppes.&nbsp; They were converted to Christianity
chiefly through the instrumentality of Istvan or Stephen, called
after his death St. Istvan, who ascended the throne in the year
one thousand.&nbsp; He was born in heathenesse, and his original
name was Vojk: he was the first <i>kiraly</i>, or king, of the
Magyars.&nbsp; Their former leaders had been called
<i>fejedelmek</i>, or dukes.&nbsp; The Magyar language has
properly no term either for king or house.&nbsp; <i>Kiraly</i> is
a word derived from the Sclaves; <i>haz</i>, or house, from the
Germans, who first taught them to build houses, their original
dwellings having been tilted waggons.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Many thanks for your account of the great
men of your country.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; The great men of my country!&nbsp; I
have only told you of the&mdash;&nbsp; Well, I acknowledge that
Almus and Arpad were great men, but Hungary has produced many
greater; I will <a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>not trouble you by recapitulating all, but there is one
name I cannot forbear mentioning&mdash;but you have heard of
it&mdash;even at Horncastle the name of Hunyadi must be
familiar.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; It may be so, though I rather doubt it;
but, however that may be, I confess my ignorance.&nbsp; I have
never, until this moment, heard the name of Hunyadi.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Not of Hunyadi Janos, not of Hunyadi
John&mdash;for the genius of our language compels us to put a
man&rsquo;s Christian name after his other; perhaps you have
heard of the name of Corvinus?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Yes, I have heard of the name of
Corvinus.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; By my God, I am glad of it; I thought
our hammer of destruction, our thunderbolt, whom the Greeks
called Achilles, must be known to the people of Horncastle.&nbsp;
Well, Hunyadi and Corvinus are the same.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Corvinus means the man of the crow, or
raven.&nbsp; I suppose that your John, when a boy, climbed up to
a crow or a raven&rsquo;s nest, and stole the young; a bold feat,
well befitting a young hero.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; By Isten, you are an acute guesser; a
robbery there was, but it was not Hunyadi who robbed the raven,
but the raven who robbed Hunyadi.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; How was that?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; In this manner: Hunyadi, according to
tradition, was the son of King Sigmond, by a peasant&rsquo;s
daughter.&nbsp; The king saw and fell in love with her, whilst
marching against the vaivode of Wallachia.&nbsp; He had some
difficulty in persuading her to consent to his wishes, and she
only yielded at last on the king making her a solemn promise
that, in the event of her becoming with child by him, he would
handsomely provide for her and the infant.&nbsp; The king
proceeded on his expedition, and on his returning in triumph from
Wallachia, he again saw the girl, who informed him that she was
<i>enceinte</i> by him; the king was delighted with the
intelligence, gave the girl money, and at the same time a ring,
requesting her, if she brought forth a son, to bring the ring to
Buda with the child, and present it to him.&nbsp; When her time
was up, the peasant&rsquo;s daughter brought forth a fair son,
who was baptised by the name of John.&nbsp; After some time the
young woman communicated the whole affair to her elder brother,
whose name was Gaspar, and begged him to convey her and the child
to the king at Buda.&nbsp; The brother consented, and both set
out, taking the child with them.&nbsp; On their way, the woman,
wanting to wash her clothes, laid the child down, giving it the
king&rsquo;s ring <a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>to play with.&nbsp; A raven, who saw the glittering
ring, came flying, and plucking it out of the child&rsquo;s hand,
carried it up into a tree; the child suddenly began to cry, and
the mother, hearing it, left her washing, and running to the
child, forthwith missed the ring, but hearing the raven croak in
the tree, she lifted up her eyes, and saw it with the ring in its
beak.&nbsp; The woman, in great terror, called her brother, and
told him what had happened, adding, that she durst not approach
the king if the raven took away the ring.&nbsp; Gaspar, seizing
his cross-bow and quiver, ran to the tree, where the raven was
yet with the ring, and discharged an arrow at it, but, being in a
great hurry, he missed it; with his second shot he was more
lucky, for he hit the raven in the breast, which, together with
the ring, fell to the ground.&nbsp; Taking up the ring, they went
on their way, and shortly arrived at Buda.&nbsp; One day, as the
king was walking after dinner in his outer hall, the woman
appeared before him with the child, and, showing him the ring,
said: &ldquo;Mighty lord! behold this token! and take pity upon
me and your own son&rdquo;.&nbsp; King Sigmond took the child and
kissed it, and, after a pause said to the mother: &ldquo;You have
done right in bringing me the boy; I will take care of you, and
make him a nobleman&rdquo;.&nbsp; The king was as good as his
word; he provided for the mother, caused the boy to be instructed
in knightly exercises, and made him a present of the town of
Hunyad, in Transylvania, on which account he was afterwards
called Hunyadi, and gave him, as an armorial sign, a raven
bearing a ring in his beak.</p>
<p>Such, oh young man of Horncastle! is the popular account of
the birth of the great captain of Hungary, as related by
Florentius of Buda.&nbsp; There are other accounts of his birth,
which is, indeed, involved in much mystery, and of the reason of
his being called Corvinus, but as this is the most pleasing, and
is, upon the whole, founded on quite as good evidence as the
others, I have selected it for recitation.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I heartily thank you; but you must tell
me something more of Hunyadi.&nbsp; You call him your great
captain; what did he do?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Do! what no other man of his day could
have done.&nbsp; He broke the power of the Turk when he was
coming to overwhelm Europe.&nbsp; From the blows inflicted by
Hunyadi, the Turk never thoroughly recovered; he has been
frequently worsted in latter times, but none but Hunyadi could
have routed the armies of Amurath and Mahomed the Second.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; How was it that he had an opportunity of
displaying his military genius?</p>
<p><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; I can hardly tell you, but his
valour soon made him famous; King Albert made him Ban of
Szorenyi.&nbsp; He became eventually waivode of Transylvania, and
governor of Hungary.&nbsp; His first grand action was the defeat
of Bashaw Isack; and though himself surprised and routed at St.
Imre, he speedily regained his prestige by defeating the Turks,
with enormous slaughter, killing their leader, Mezerbeg; and
subsequently, at the battle of the Iron Gates, he destroyed
ninety thousand Turks, sent by Amurath to avenge the late
disgrace.&nbsp; It was then that the Greeks called him
Achilles.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; He was not always successful.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Who could be always successful against
the early Turk?&nbsp; He was defeated in the battle in which King
Vladislaus lost his life, but his victories outnumbered his
defeats three-fold.&nbsp; His grandest victory&mdash;perhaps the
grandest ever achieved by man&mdash;was over the terrible Mahomed
the Second; who, after the taking of Constantinople in 1453,
said: &ldquo;One God in Heaven&mdash;one king on earth&rdquo;;
and marched to besiege Belgrade at the head of one hundred and
fifty thousand men; swearing by the beard of the prophet,
&ldquo;That he would sup within it ere two months were
elapsed&rdquo;.&nbsp; He brought with him dogs, to eat the bodies
of the Christians whom he should take or slay; so says
Florentius; hear what he also says: The Turk sat down before the
town towards the end of June, 1454, covering the Dunau and Szava
with ships: and on the 4th of July he began to cannonade Belgrade
with cannons twenty-five feet long, whose roar could be heard at
Szeged, a distance of twenty-four leagues, at which place Hunyadi
had assembled his forces.&nbsp; Hunyadi had been able to raise
only fifteen thousand of well-armed and disciplined men, though
he had with him vast bands of people, who called themselves
Soldiers of the Cross, but who consisted of inexperienced lads
from school, peasants and hermits, armed with swords, slings and
clubs.&nbsp; Hunyadi, undismayed by the great disparity between
his forces and those of the Turk, advanced to relieve Belgrade,
and encamped at Szalankemen with his army.&nbsp; There he saw at
once that his first step must be to attack the flotilla; he
therefore privately informed Szilagy, his wife&rsquo;s brother,
who at that time defended Belgrade, that it was his intention to
attack the ships of the Turks on the 14th day of July in front,
and requested his co-operation in the rear.&nbsp; On the 14th
came on the commencement of the great battle of Belgrade, between
Hunyadi and the Turk.&nbsp; Many days it lasted.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Describe it.</p>
<p><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; I cannot.&nbsp; One has
described it well&mdash;Florentius of Buda.&nbsp; I can only
repeat a few of his words: &ldquo;On the appointed day, Hunyadi,
with two hundred vessels, attacked the Turkish flotilla in front,
whilst Szilagy, with forty vessels, filled with the men of
Belgrade, assailed it in the rear; striving for the same object,
they sunk many of the Turkish vessels, captured seventy-four,
burnt many, and utterly annihilated the whole fleet.&nbsp; After
this victory, Hunyadi, with his army entered Belgrade, to the
great joy of the Magyars.&nbsp; But though the force of Mahomed
upon the water was destroyed, that upon the land remained entire;
and with this, during six days and nights, he attacked the city
without intermission, destroying its walls in many parts.&nbsp;
His last and most desperate assault was made on the 21st day of
July.&nbsp; Twice did the Turks gain possession of the outer
town, and twice was it retaken with indescribable
slaughter.&nbsp; The next day the combat raged without ceasing
till midday, when the Turks were again beaten out of the town,
and pursued by the Magyars to their camp.&nbsp; There the combat
was renewed, both sides displaying the greatest obstinacy until
Mahomed received a great wound over his left eye.&nbsp; The Turks
then, turning their faces, fled, leaving behind them three
hundred cannon in the hands of the Christians, and more than
twenty-four thousand slain on the field of battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; After that battle, I suppose Hunyadi
enjoyed his triumphs in peace?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; In the deepest, for he shortly
died.&nbsp; His great soul quitted his body, which was exhausted
by almost superhuman exertions, on the 11th of August,
1456.&nbsp; Shortly before he died, according to Florentius, a
comet appeared, sent, as it would seem, to announce his coming
end.&nbsp; The whole Christian world mourned his loss.&nbsp; The
Pope ordered the cardinals to perform a funeral ceremony at Rome
in his honour.&nbsp; His great enemy himself grieved for him, and
pronounced his finest eulogium.&nbsp; When Mahomed the Second
heard of his death, he struck his head for some time against the
ground without speaking.&nbsp; Suddenly he broke silence with
these words: &ldquo;Notwithstanding he was my enemy, yet do I
bewail his loss; since the sun has shone in heaven, no Prince had
ever yet such a man&rdquo;.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; What was the name of his Prince?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Laszlo the Fifth; who, though under
infinite obligations to Hunyadi, was anything but grateful to
him; for he once consented to a plan which was laid to
assassinate him, contrived by his mortal enemy Ulrik, Count of
Cilejia; and after Hunyadi&rsquo;s death, caused his eldest son
Hunyadi Laszlo, to be <a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>executed on a false accusation, and
imprisoned his younger son, Matyas, who, on the death of Laszlo,
was elected by the Magyars to be their king, on the 24th of
January, 1458.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Was this Matyas a good king?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Was Matyas Corvinus a good king?&nbsp;
O young man of Horncastle! he was the best and greatest that
Hungary ever possessed, and, after his father, the most renowned
warrior&mdash;some of our best laws were framed by him.&nbsp; It
was he who organised the Hussar force, and it was he who took
Vienna.&nbsp; Why does your Government always send fools to
represent it at Vienna?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I really cannot say; but with respect to
the Hussar force, is it of Hungarian origin?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Its name shows its origin.&nbsp;
<i>Huz</i>, in Hungarian, is twenty and the Hussar force is so
called because it is formed of twentieths.&nbsp; A law was issued
by which it was ordered that every Hungarian nobleman, out of
every twenty dependants, should produce a well-equipped horseman,
and with him proceed to the field of battle.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Why did Matyas capture Vienna?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Because the Emperor Frederick took
part against him with the King of Poland, who claimed the kingdom
of Hungary for his son, and had also assisted the Turk.&nbsp; He
captured it in the year 1487, but did not survive his triumph
long, expiring there in the year 1490.&nbsp; He was so veracious
a man, that it was said of him, after his death, &ldquo;Truth
died with Matyas&rdquo;.&nbsp; It might be added that the glory
of Hungary departed with him.&nbsp; I wish to say nothing more
connected with Hungarian history.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Another word.&nbsp; Did Matyas leave a
son?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; A natural son, Hunyadi John, called so
after the great man.&nbsp; He would have been universally
acknowledged as King of Hungary but for the illegitimacy of his
birth.&nbsp; As it was, Ulaszlo, the son of the King of Poland,
afterwards called Ulaszlo the Second, who claimed Hungary as
being descended from Albert, was nominated king by a great
majority of the Magyar electors.&nbsp; Hunyadi John for some time
disputed the throne with him; there was some bloodshed, but
Hunyadi John eventually submitted, and became the faithful
captain of Ulaszlo, notwithstanding that the Turk offered to
assist him with an army of two hundred thousand men.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Go on.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; To what?&nbsp; Tch&eacute; Drak, to
the <i>Mohacs Veszedelem</i>.&nbsp; Ulaszlo left a son, Lajos the
Second, born without skin, as it is <a name="page231"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>said; certainly without a
head.&nbsp; He, contrary to the advice of all his wise
counsellors,&mdash;and amongst them was Batory Stephen, who
became eventually King of Poland&mdash;engaged, with twenty-five
thousand men, at Mohacs, Soliman the Turk, who had an army of two
hundred thousand.&nbsp; Drak! the Magyars were annihilated, King
Lajos disappeared with his heavy horse and armour in a bog.&nbsp;
We call that battle, which was fought on the 29th of August,
1526, the destruction of Mohacs, but it was the destruction of
Hungary.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; You have twice used the word <i>drak</i>,
what is the meaning of it?&nbsp; Is it Hungarian?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; No! it belongs to the mad
Wallacks.&nbsp; They are a nation of madmen on the other side of
Transylvania.&nbsp; Their country was formerly a fief of Hungary,
like Moldavia, which is inhabited by the same race, who speak the
same language and are equally mad.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; What language do they speak?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; A strange mixture of Latin and
Sclavonian&mdash;they themselves being a mixed race of Romans and
Sclavonians.&nbsp; Trajan sent certain legions to form military
colonies in Dacia; and the present Wallacks and Moldavians are,
to a certain extent, the descendants of the Roman soldiers, who
married the women of the country.&nbsp; I say to a certain
extent, for the Sclavonian element both in blood and language
seems to prevail.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; And what is <i>drak</i>?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Dragon; which the Wallacks use for
&ldquo;devil&rdquo;.&nbsp; The term is curious, as it shows that
the old Romans looked upon the dragon as an infernal being.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; You have been in Wallachia?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; I have, and glad I was to get out of
it.&nbsp; I hate the mad Wallacks.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Why do you call them mad?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; They are always drinking or
talking.&nbsp; I never saw a Wallachian eating or silent.&nbsp;
They talk like madmen, and drink like madmen.&nbsp; In drinking
they use small phials, the contents of which they pour down their
throats.&nbsp; When I first went amongst them I thought the whole
nation was under a course of physic, but the terrible jabber of
their tongues soon undeceived me.&nbsp; <i>Drak</i> was the first
word I heard on entering Dacia, and the last when I left
it.&nbsp; The Moldaves, if possible, drink more, and talk more
than the Wallachians.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; It is singular enough that the only
Moldavian I have known could not speak.&nbsp; I suppose he was
born dumb.</p>
<p><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; A Moldavian born dumb!&nbsp;
Excuse me, the thing is impossible,&mdash;all Moldavians are born
talking!&nbsp; I have known a Moldavian who could not speak, but
he was not born dumb.&nbsp; His master, an Armenian, snipped off
part of his tongue at Adrianople.&nbsp; He drove him mad with his
jabber.&nbsp; He is now in London, where his master has a
house.&nbsp; I have letters of credit on the house: the clerk
paid me money in London, the master was absent; the money which
you received for the horse belonged to that house.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Another word with respect to Hungarian
history.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Drak!&nbsp; I wish to say nothing more
about Hungarian history.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; The Turk, I suppose, after Mohacs, got
possession of Hungary?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Not exactly.&nbsp; The Turk, upon the
whole, showed great moderation; not so the Austrian.&nbsp;
Ferdinand the First claimed the crown of Hungary as being the
cousin of Maria, widow of Lajos; he found too many disposed to
support him.&nbsp; His claim, however, was resisted by Zapolya
John, a Hungarian magnate, who caused himself to be elected
king.&nbsp; Hungary was for a long time devastated by wars
between the partisans of Zapolya and Ferdinand.&nbsp; At last
Zapolya called in the Turk.&nbsp; Soliman behaved generously to
him, and after his death befriended his young son, and Isabella
his queen; eventually the Turks became masters of Transylvania
and the greater part of Hungary.&nbsp; They were not bad masters,
and had many friends in Hungary, especially amongst those of the
reformed faith, to which I have myself the honour of belonging;
those of the reformed faith found the Mufti more tolerant than
the Pope.&nbsp; Many Hungarians went with the Turks to the siege
of Vienna, whilst Tekeli and his horsemen guarded Hungary for
them.&nbsp; A gallant enterprise that siege of Vienna, the last
great effort of the Turk; it failed and he speedily lost Hungary,
but he did not sneak from Hungary like a frightened hound.&nbsp;
His defence of Buda will not be soon forgotten, where Apty Basha,
the governor, died fighting like a lion in the breach.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s many a Hungarian would prefer Stamboul to
Vienna.&nbsp; Why does your Government always send fools to
represent it at Vienna?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I have already told you that I cannot
say.&nbsp; What became of Tekeli?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; When Hungary was lost he retired with
the Turks into Turkey.&nbsp; Count Renoncourt, in his
<i>Memoirs</i>, mentions having seen him at Adrianople.&nbsp; The
Sultan, in consideration of the <a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>services which he had rendered to
the Moslem in Hungary, made over the revenues of certain towns
and districts for his subsistence.&nbsp; The count says that he
always went armed to the teeth, and was always attended by a
young female dressed in male attire, who had followed him in his
wars, and had more than once saved his life.&nbsp; His end is
wrapped in mystery, I&mdash;whose greatest boast, next to being a
Hungarian, is to be of his blood&mdash;know nothing of his
end.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Allow me to ask who you are?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; <i>Egy szegeny Magyar Nemes ember</i>,
a poor Hungarian nobleman, son of one yet poorer.&nbsp; I was
born in Transylvania, not far to the west of good
Coloscvar.&nbsp; I served some time in the Austrian army as a
noble Hussar, but am now equerry to a great nobleman, to whom I
am distantly related.&nbsp; In his service I have travelled far
and wide, buying horses.&nbsp; I have been in Russia and in
Turkey, and am now at Horncastle, where I have had the
satisfaction to meet with you, and to buy your horse, which is,
in truth, a noble brute.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; For a soldier and equerry you seem to
know a great deal of the history of your country.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; All I know is derived from Florentius
of Buda, whom we call Budai Ferentz.&nbsp; He was professor of
Greek and Latin at the Reformed College of Debreczen, where I was
educated; he wrote a work entitled <i>Magyar Polgari Lexicon</i>,
Lives of Great Hungarian Citizens.&nbsp; He was dead before I was
born, but I found his book, when I was a child, in the solitary
home of my father, which stood on the confines of a
<i>puszta</i>, or wilderness, and that book I used to devour in
winter nights when the winds were whistling around the
house.&nbsp; Oh! how my blood used to glow at the descriptions of
Magyar valour, and likewise of Turkish; for Florentius has always
done justice to the Turk.&nbsp; Many a passage similar to this
have I got by heart; it is connected with a battle on the plain
of Rigo, which Hunyadi lost: &ldquo;The next day, which was
Friday, as the two armies were drawn up in battle array, a Magyar
hero, riding forth, galloped up and down, challenging the Turks
to single combat.&nbsp; Then came out to meet him the son of a
renowned bashaw of Asia; rushing upon each other, both broke
their lances, but the Magyar hero and his horse rolled over upon
the ground, for the Turks had always the best
horses.&rdquo;&nbsp; O young man of Horncastle! if ever you learn
Hungarian&mdash;and learn it assuredly you will after what I have
told you&mdash;read the book of Florentius of Buda, even if you
go to Hungary to get it, for you will scarcely find it elsewhere,
and even there with difficulty, <a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>for the book has been long out of
print.&nbsp; It describes the actions of the great men of Hungary
down to the middle of the sixteenth century; and besides being
written in the purest Hungarian, has the merit of having for its
author a professor of the Reformed College at Debreczen.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; I will go to Hungary rather than not read
it.&nbsp; I am glad that the Turk beat the Magyar.&nbsp; When I
used to read the ballads of Spain I always sided with the Moor
against the Christian.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; It was a drawn fight after all, for
the terrible horse of the Turk presently flung his own master,
whereupon the two champions returned to their respective armies;
but in the grand conflict which ensued, the Turks beat the
Magyars, pursuing them till night, and striking them on the necks
with their scimitars.&nbsp; The Turk is a noble fellow; I should
wish to be a Turk, were I not a Magyar.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; The Turk always keeps his word, I am
told.</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Which the Christian very seldom does,
and even the Hungarian does not always.&nbsp; In 1444 Ulaszlo
made, at Szeged, peace with Amurath for ten years, which he swore
with an oath to keep, but at the instigation of the Pope Julian
he broke it, and induced his great captain, Hunyadi John, to
share in the perjury.&nbsp; The consequence was the battle of
Varna, of the 10th of November, in which Hunyadi was routed, and
Ulaszlo slain.&nbsp; Did you ever hear his epitaph? it is both
solemn and edifying:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Romulid&aelig; Cannas ego Varnam clade notavi;<br
/>
Discite mortales non temerare fidem:<br />
Me nisi Pontifices jussissent rumpere f&oelig;dus<br />
Non ferret Scythicum Pannonis ora jugum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Halloo!&rdquo; said the jockey, starting up from a doze
in which he had been indulging for the last hour, his head
leaning upon his breast, &ldquo;what is that?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
not High Dutch; I bargained for High Dutch, and I left you
speaking what I believed to be High Dutch, as it sounded very
much like the language of horses, as I have been told High Dutch
does; but as for what you are speaking now, whatever you may call
it, it sounds more like the language of another kind of
animal.&nbsp; I suppose you want to insult me, because I was once
a dicky-boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the kind,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;the
gentleman was making a quotation in Latin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Latin, was it?&rdquo; said the jockey; &ldquo;that
alters the case.&nbsp; Latin is genteel, and I have sent my
eldest boy to an academy to <a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>learn it.&nbsp; Come, let us hear
you fire away in Latin,&rdquo; he continued, proceeding to
relight his pipe, which, before going to sleep, he had laid on
the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wish to follow the discourse in Latin,&rdquo;
said the Hungarian, in very bad English, &ldquo;I can oblige you;
I learned to speak very good Latin in the college of
Debreczen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;than I have
done in the colleges where I have been; in any little
conversation which we may yet have, I wish you would use
German.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the jockey, taking a whiff,
&ldquo;make your conversation as short as possible, whether in
Latin or Dutch, for, to tell you the truth, I am rather tired of
merely playing listener.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were saying you had been in Russia,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;I believe the Russians are part of the Sclavonian
race.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Yes, part of the great Sclavonian
family; one of the most numerous races in the world.&nbsp; The
Russians themselves are very numerous; would that the Magyars
could boast of the fifth part of their number!</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; What is the number of the Magyars?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Barely four millions.&nbsp; We came a
tribe of Tartars into Europe, and settled down amongst
Sclavonians, whom we conquered, but who never coalesced with
us.&nbsp; The Austrian at present plays in Pannonia the
Sclavonian against us, and us against the Sclavonian; but the
downfall of the Austrian is at hand; they, like us, are not a
numerous people.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Who will bring about his downfall?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; The Russians.&nbsp; The Rysckie Tsar
will lead his people forth, all the Sclavonians will join him, he
will conquer all before him.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Are the Russians good soldiers?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; They are stubborn and unflinching to
an astonishing degree, and their fidelity to their Tsar is quite
admirable.&nbsp; See how the Russians behaved at Plescova, in
Livonia, in the old time, against our great Batory Stephen; they
defended the place till it was a heap of rubbish, and mark how
they behaved after they had been made prisoners.&nbsp; Stephen
offered them two alternatives: to enter into his service, in
which they would have good pay, clothing and fair treatment; or
to be allowed to return to Russia.&nbsp; Without the slightest
hesitation they, to a man, chose the latter, though well aware
that their beloved Tsar, the cruel Ivan Basilowits, would put
them all to death, amidst tortures the most horrible, for not
doing what was impossible&mdash;preserving the town.</p>
<p><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; You speak Russian?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; A little.&nbsp; I was born in the
vicinity of a Sclavonian tribe; the servants of our house were
Sclavonians, and I early acquired something of their language,
which differs not much from that of Russia; when in that country
I quickly understood what was said.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Have the Russians any literature?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; Doubtless; but I am not acquainted
with it, as I do not read their language; but I know something of
their popular tales, to which I used to listen in their
<i>izbushkas</i>; a principal personage in these is a creation
quite original&mdash;called Baba Yaga.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Who is Baba Yaga?</p>
<p><i>Hungarian</i>.&nbsp; A female phantom, who is described as
hurrying along the <i>puszta</i>, or steppe, in a mortar,
pounding with a pestle at a tremendous rate, and leaving a long
trace on the ground behind her with her tongue, which is three
yards long, and with which she seizes any men and horses coming
in her way, swallowing them down into her capacious belly.&nbsp;
She has several daughters, very handsome, and with plenty of
money; happy the young Mujik who catches and marries one of them,
for they make excellent wives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many thanks,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for the information
you have afforded me: this is rather poor wine,&rdquo; I
observed, as I poured out a glass; &ldquo;I suppose you have
better wine in Hungary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we have better wine in Hungary.&nbsp; First of all
there is Tokay, the most celebrated in the world, though I
confess I prefer the wine of Eger&mdash;Tokay is too
sweet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever been at Tokay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said the Hungarian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of place is Tokay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A small town situated on the Tyzza, a rapid river
descending from the north; the Tokay Mountain is just behind the
town, which stands on the right bank.&nbsp; The top of the
mountain is called Kopacs Teto, or the bald tip; the hill is so
steep that during thunderstorms pieces of it frequently fall down
upon the roofs of the houses.&nbsp; It was planted with vines by
King Lajos, who ascended the throne in the year 1342.&nbsp; The
best wine called Tokay is, however, not made at Tokay, but at
Kassau, two leagues farther into the Carpathians, of which Tokay
is a spur.&nbsp; If you wish to drink the best Tokay, you must go
to Vienna, to which place all the prime is sent.&nbsp; For the
third time I ask you, O young man of Horncastle! why does your
Government always send fools to represent it at
Vienna?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>&ldquo;And for the third time I tell you, O son of
Almus! that I cannot say; perhaps, however, to drink the sweet
Tokay wine; fools, you know, always like sweet things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the Hungarian; &ldquo;it must be so,
and when I return to Hungary, I will state to my countrymen your
explanation of a circumstance which has frequently caused them
great perplexity.&nbsp; Oh! the English are a clever people, and
have a deep meaning in all they do.&nbsp; What a vision of deep
policy opens itself to my view! they do not send their fool to
Vienna in order to gape at processions, and to bow and scrape at
a base Papist court, but to drink at the great dinners the
celebrated Tokay of Hungary, which the Hungarians, though they do
not drink it, are very proud of, and by doing so to intimate the
sympathy which the English entertain for their fellow
religionists of Hungary.&nbsp; Oh! the English are a deep
people.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>CHAPTER XL.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> pipe of the Hungarian had, for
some time past, exhibited considerable symptoms of exhaustion,
little or no ruttling having been heard in the tube, and scarcely
a particle of smoke, drawn through the syphon, having been
emitted from the lips of the possessor.&nbsp; He now rose from
his seat, and going to a corner of the room, placed his pipe
against the wall, then striding up and down the room, he cracked
his fingers several times, exclaiming, in a half-musing manner:
&ldquo;Oh, the deep nation, which, in order to display its
sympathy for Hungary, sends its fool to Vienna, to drink the
sweet wine of Tokay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The jockey, having looked for some time at the tall figure
with evident approbation, winked at me with that brilliant eye of
his on which there was no speck, saying: &ldquo;Did you ever see
a taller fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or a finer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s another question,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;which I am not so willing to answer; however, as I am fond
of truth, and scorn to flatter, I will take the liberty of saying
that I have seen a finer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A finer! where?&rdquo; said the jockey; whilst the
Hungarian, who appeared to understand what we said, stood still,
and looked full at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amongst a strange set of people,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;whom, if I were to name, you would, I daresay, only laugh
at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who be they?&rdquo; said the jockey.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come,
don&rsquo;t be ashamed; I have occasionally kept queerish company
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people whom we call gypsies,&rdquo; said I;
&ldquo;whom the Germans call Zigeuner, and who call themselves
Romany chals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zigeuner!&rdquo; said the Hungarian; &ldquo;by
Isten!&nbsp; I do know those people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Romany chals!&rdquo; said the jockey;
&ldquo;whew!&nbsp; I begin to smell a rat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by smelling a rat?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet a crown,&rdquo; said the jockey,
&ldquo;that you be the young chap what certain folks call
&lsquo;the Romany Rye&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;how came you to know
that name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be not you he?&rdquo; said the jockey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I certainly have been called by that
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could have sworn it,&rdquo; said the jockey; then
rising from his chair, he laid his pipe on the table, took a
large hand-bell which stood on the sideboard, and going to the
door, opened it, and commenced ringing in a most tremendous
manner on the staircase.&nbsp; The noise presently brought up a
waiter, to whom the jockey vociferated, &ldquo;Go to your master,
and tell him to send immediately three bottles of champagne, of
the pink kind, mind you, which is twelve guineas a dozen&rdquo;;
the waiter hurried away, and the jockey resumed his seat and his
pipe.&nbsp; I sat in silent astonishment until the waiter
returned with a basket containing the wine, which, with three
long glasses, he placed on the table.&nbsp; The jockey then got
up, and going to a large bow window at the end of the room, which
looked into a courtyard, peeped out; then saying, &ldquo;the
coast is clear,&rdquo; he shut down the principal sash which was
open for the sake of the air, and taking up a bottle of
champagne, he placed another in the hands of the Hungarian, to
whom he said something in private.&nbsp; The latter, who seemed
to understand him, answered by a nod.&nbsp; The two then going to
the end of the table fronting the window, and about eight paces
from it, stood before it, holding the bottles by their necks;
suddenly the jockey lifted up his arm.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you are not mad enough to
fling that bottle through the window?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to the Romany Rye; here&rsquo;s to the sweet
master,&rdquo; said the jockey, dashing the bottle through a pane
in so neat a manner that scarcely a particle of glass fell into
the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Eljen edes csigany ur&mdash;eljen gul
eray</i>!&rdquo; said the Hungarian, swinging round his bottle,
and discharging it at the window; but, either not possessing the
jockey&rsquo;s accuracy of aim, or reckless of consequences, he
flung his bottle so, that it struck against part of the wooden
setting of the panes, breaking along with the wood and itself
three or four panes to pieces.&nbsp; The crash was horrid, and
wine and particles of glass flew back into the room, to the no
small danger of its inmates.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you think of
that?&rdquo; said the jockey; &ldquo;were you ever so honoured
before?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Honoured!&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;God preserve me in future from such honour;&rdquo; and I
put my finger to my cheek, which was slightly hurt by a particle
of the glass.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way we of the cofrady
honour great men at Horncastle,&rdquo; said the jockey.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What, you are hurt! never mind; all the better; your
scratch shows that you are the body the compliment was paid
to.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And what are you going <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>to do with
the other bottle?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do with it!&rdquo;
said the jockey, &ldquo;why, drink it, cosily and comfortably,
whilst holding a little quiet talk.&nbsp; The Romany Rye at
Horncastle, what an idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what will the master of the house say to all this
damage which you have caused him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will your master say, William?&rdquo; said the
jockey to the waiter, who had witnessed the singular scene just
described without exhibiting the slightest mark of
surprise.&nbsp; William smiled, and slightly shrugging his
shoulders, replied: &ldquo;Very little, I dare say, sir; this
a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t the first time your honour has done a thing of
this kind&rdquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nor will it be the first time that
I shall have paid for it,&rdquo; said the jockey; &ldquo;well, I
shall never have paid for a certain item in the bill with more
pleasure than I shall pay for it now.&nbsp; Come, William, draw
the cork, and let us taste the pink champagne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The waiter drew the cork, and filled the glasses with a pinky
liquor, which bubbled, hissed and foamed.&nbsp; &ldquo;How do you
like it?&rdquo; said the jockey, after I had imitated the example
of my companions, by despatching my portion at a draught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is wonderful wine,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I have
never tasted champagne before, though I have frequently heard it
praised; it more than answers my expectations; but, I confess, I
should not wish to be obliged to drink it every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said the jockey, &ldquo;for everyday
drinking give me a glass of old port, or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of hard old ale,&rdquo; I interposed, &ldquo;which,
according to my mind, is better than all the wine in the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well said, Romany Rye,&rdquo; said the jockey,
&ldquo;just my own opinion; now, William, make yourself
scarce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The waiter withdrew, and I said to the jockey: &ldquo;How did
you become acquainted with the Romany chals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I first became acquainted with them,&rdquo; said the
jockey, &ldquo;when I lived with old Fulcher the basketmaker, who
took me up when I was adrift upon the world; I do not mean the
present Fulcher, who is likewise called old Fulcher, but his
father, who has been dead this many a year; while living with him
in the caravan, I frequently met them in the green lanes, and of
latter years I have had occasional dealings with them in the
horse line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the gypsies have mentioned me to you?&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frequently,&rdquo; said the jockey, &ldquo;and not only
those of these parts; why, there&rsquo;s scarcely a part of
England in which I have not heard the name of the Romany Rye
mentioned by these <a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>people.&nbsp; The power you have over them is
wonderful; that is, I should have thought it wonderful, had they
not more than once told me the cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is the cause?&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for I am
sure I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cause is this,&rdquo; said the jockey, &ldquo;they
never heard a bad word proceed from your mouth, and never knew
you do a bad thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are a singular people,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what a singular language they have got,&rdquo; said
the jockey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know it?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a few words,&rdquo; said the jockey; &ldquo;they
were always chary in teaching me any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were vary sherry to me to,&rdquo; said the
Hungarian, speaking in broken English; &ldquo;I only could learn
from them half a dozen words, for example, <i>gul eray</i>,
which, in the czigany of my country, means sweet gentleman, or
<i>edes ur</i> in my own Magyar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gudlo Rye, in the Romany of mine, means a sugar&rsquo;d
gentleman,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;then there are gypsies in your
country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty,&rdquo; said the Hungarian, speaking German,
&ldquo;and in Russia and Turkey too; and wherever they are found,
they are alike in their ways and language.&nbsp; Oh, they are a
strange race, and how little known!&nbsp; I know little of them,
but enough to say that one horse-load of nonsense has been
written about them; there is one Valter Scott&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind what you say about him,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;he
is our grand authority in matters of philology and
history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty philologist,&rdquo; said the Hungarian,
&ldquo;who makes the gypsies speak Roth-Welsch, the dialect of
thieves; a pretty historian, who couples together Thor and
Tzernebock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does he do that?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In his conceited romance of <i>Ivanhoe</i>, he couples
Thor and Tzernebock together, and calls them gods of the heathen
Saxons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Thur or Thor was certainly
a god of the heathen Saxons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the Hungarian; &ldquo;but why couple
him with Tzernebock?&nbsp; Tzernebock was a word which your
Valter had picked up somewhere without knowing the meaning.&nbsp;
Tzernebock was no god of the Saxons, but one of the gods of the
Sclaves, on the southern side of the Baltic.&nbsp; The Sclaves
had two grand gods to whom they sacrificed, Tzernebock and
Bielebock; that is, the black and white gods, who represented the
powers of dark and <a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>light.&nbsp; They were overturned by Waldemar, the
Dane, the great enemy of the Sclaves; the account of whose wars
you will find in one fine old book, written by Saxo Gramaticus,
which I read in the library of the college of Debreczen.&nbsp;
The Sclaves, at one time, were masters of all the southern shore
of the Baltic, where their descendants are still to be found,
though they have lost their language, and call themselves
Germans; but the word Zernevitz near Dantzic, still attests that
the Sclavic language was once common in those parts.&nbsp;
Zernevitz means the thing of blackness, as Tzernebock means the
god of blackness.&nbsp; Prussia itself merely means, in Sclavish,
Lower Russia.&nbsp; There is scarcely a race or language in the
world more extended than the Sclavic.&nbsp; On the other side of
the Dunau you will find the Sclaves and their language.&nbsp;
Czernavoda is Sclavic, and means black water; in Turkish, <i>kara
su</i>; even as Tzernebock means black god; and Belgrade, or
Belograd, means the white town, even as Bielebock, or Bielebog,
means the white god.&nbsp; Oh! he is one great ignorant, that
Valter.&nbsp; He is going, they say, to write one history about
Napoleon.&nbsp; I do hope that in his history he will couple his
Thor and Tzernebock together.&nbsp; By my God! it would be good
diversion that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walter Scott appears to be no particular favourite of
yours,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not,&rdquo; said the Hungarian; &ldquo;I hate him
for his slavish principles.&nbsp; He wishes to see absolute power
restored in this country, and Popery also&mdash;and I hate him
because&mdash;what do you think?&nbsp; In one of his novels,
published a few months ago, he has the insolence to insult
Hungary in the person of one of her sons.&nbsp; He makes his
great braggart, C&oelig;ur de Lion, fling a Magyar over his
head.&nbsp; Ha! it was well for Richard that he never felt the
gripe of a Hungarian.&nbsp; I wish the braggart could have felt
the grip of me, who am &lsquo;<i>a&rsquo; magyarok k&ouml;zt
legkissebb</i>,&rsquo; the least among the Magyars.&nbsp; I do
hate that Scott, and all his vile gang of Lowlanders and
Highlanders.&nbsp; The black corps, the <i>fekete</i> regiment of
Matyas Hunyadi, was worth all the Scots, high or low, that ever
pretended to be soldiers; and would have sent them all headlong
into the Black Sea, had they dared to confront it on its shores;
but why be angry with an ignorant, who couples together Thor and
Tzernebock?&nbsp; Ha! Ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have read his novels?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I read them now and then.&nbsp; I do not speak
much English, but I can read it well, and I have read some of his
<a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>romances
and mean to read his <i>Napoleon</i>, in the hope of finding Thor
and Tzernebock coupled together in it, as in his high-flying
<i>Ivanhoe</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the jockey, &ldquo;no more Dutch,
whether high or low.&nbsp; I am tired of it; unless we can have
some English, I am off to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be very glad to hear some English,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;especially from your mouth.&nbsp; Several things which
you have mentioned, have awakened my curiosity.&nbsp; Suppose you
give us your history?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My history?&rdquo; said the jockey.&nbsp; &ldquo;A rum
idea! however, less conversation should lag, I&rsquo;ll give it
you.&nbsp; First of all, however, a glass of champagne to
each.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After we had each taken a glass of champagne, the jockey
commenced his history.</p>
<h2><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>CHAPTER XLI.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My</span> grandfather was a
shorter, and my father was a smasher; the one was scragg&rsquo;d,
and the other lagg&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I here interrupted the jockey by observing that his discourse
was, for the greater part, unintelligible to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand much English,&rdquo; said the
Hungarian, who, having replenished and resumed his mighty pipe,
was now smoking away; &ldquo;but, by Isten, I believe it is the
gibberish which that great ignorant Valter Scott puts into the
mouth of the folks he calls gypsies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like it, I confess,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;though this sounds more genuine than his dialect, which he
picked up out of the canting vocabulary at the end of the
<i>English Rogue</i>, a book which, however despised, was written
by a remarkable genius.&nbsp; What do you call the speech you
were using?&rdquo; said I, addressing myself to the jockey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Latin,&rdquo; said the jockey very coolly; &ldquo;that
is, that dialect of it which is used by the light-fingered
gentry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is right,&rdquo; said the Hungarian; &ldquo;it is
what the Germans call Roth-Welsch: they call it so because there
are a great many Latin words in it, introduced by the priests,
who, at the time of the Reformation, being too lazy to work and
too stupid to preach, joined the bands of thieves and robbers who
prowled about the country.&nbsp; Italy, as you are aware, is
called by the Germans Welschland, or the land of the Welschers;
and I may add that Wallachia derives its name from a colony of
Welschers which Trajan sent there.&nbsp; Welsch and Wallack being
one and the same word, and tantamount to Latin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say you are right,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but why
was Italy termed Welschland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said the Hungarian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I think I can tell you,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;it
was called so because the original inhabitants were a Cimbric
tribe, who were called Gwyltiad, that is, a race of wild people,
living in coverts, who were of the same blood, and spoke the same
language as the present inhabitants of Wales.&nbsp; Welsh seems
<a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>merely a
modification of Gwyltiad.&nbsp; Pray, continue your
history,&rdquo; said I to the jockey, &ldquo;only please to do so
in a language which we can understand, and first of all interpret
the sentence with which you began it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you that my grandfather was a shorter,&rdquo;
said the jockey, &ldquo;by which is meant a gentleman who
shortens or reduces the current coin of these realms, for which
practice he was scragged, that is, hung by the scrag of the
neck.&nbsp; And when I said that my father was a smasher, I meant
one who passes forged notes, thereby doing his best to smash the
Bank of England; by being lagged, I meant he was laid fast, that
is, had a chain put round his leg and then
transported.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your explanations are perfectly satisfactory,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;the three first words are metaphorical, and the
fourth, lagged, is the old genuine Norse term, lagda, which
signifies laid, whether in durance, or in bed, has nothing to do
with the matter.&nbsp; What you have told me confirms me in an
opinion which I have long entertained, that thieves&rsquo; Latin
is a strange, mysterious speech, formed of metaphorical terms,
and words derived from various ancient languages.&nbsp; Pray,
tell me, now, how the gentleman, your grandfather, contrived to
shorten the coin of these realms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall hear,&rdquo; said the jockey; &ldquo;but I
have one thing to beg of you, which is, that when I have once
begun my history you will not interrupt me with questions.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t like them, they stops one, and puts one out of
one&rsquo;s tale, and are not wanted; for anything which I think
can&rsquo;t be understood, I should myself explain, without being
asked.&nbsp; My grandfather reduced or shortened the coin of this
country by three processes: by aquafortis, by clipping and by
filing.&nbsp; Filing and clipping he employed in reducing all
kinds of coin, whether gold or silver; but aquafortis he used
merely in reducing gold coin, whether guineas, jacobuses or
Portugal pieces, otherwise called moidores, which were at one
time as current as guineas.&nbsp; By laying a guinea in
aquafortis for twelve hours, he could filch from it to the value
of ninepence, and by letting it remain there for twenty-four to
the value of eighteenpence, the aquafortis eating the gold away,
and leaving it like a sediment in the vessel.&nbsp; He was
generally satisfied with taking the value of ninepence from a
guinea, of eighteenpence from a jacobus or moidore, or half a
crown from a broad Spanish piece, whether he reduced them by
aquafortis, filing or clipping.&nbsp; From a five-shilling piece,
which is called a bull in Latin, because it is round like a
bull&rsquo;s head, he would file or clip to the value of
fivepence, and from lesser coin in proportion.&nbsp; He was
connected <a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>with a numerous gang, or set, of people, who had given
up their minds and talents entirely to shortening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here I interrupted the jockey.&nbsp; &ldquo;How
singular,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is the fall and debasement of
words; you talk of a gang, or set, of shorters; you are, perhaps,
not aware that gang and set were, a thousand years ago, only
connected with the great and Divine; they are ancient Norse
words, which may be found in the heroic poems of the north, and
in the Edda, a collection of mythologic and heroic songs.&nbsp;
In these poems we read that such and such a king invaded Norway
with a gang of heroes; or so and so, for example, Erik Bloodaxe,
was admitted to the set of gods; but at present gang and set are
merely applied to the vilest of the vile, and the lowest of the
low,&mdash;we say a gang of thieves and shorters, or a set of
authors.&nbsp; How touching is this debasement of words in the
course of time; it puts me in mind of the decay of old houses and
names.&nbsp; I have known a Mortimer who was a hedger and
ditcher, a Berners who was born in a workhouse, and a descendant
of the De Burghs, who bore the falcon, mending old kettles, and
making horse and pony shoes in a dingle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Odd enough,&rdquo; said the jockey; &ldquo;but you were
saying you knew one Berners&mdash;man or woman?&nbsp; I would
ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What might her Christian name be?&rdquo; said the
jockey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not to be mentioned lightly,&rdquo; said I with a
sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if it were Isopel,&rdquo; said
the jockey with an arch glance of his one brilliant eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Isopel,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;did you know
Isopel Berners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, and have reason to know her,&rdquo; said the
jockey, putting his hand into his left waistcoat pocket, as if to
feel for something, &ldquo;for she gave me what I believe few men
could do&mdash;a most confounded whopping.&nbsp; But now, Mr.
Romany Rye, I have again to tell you that I don&rsquo;t like to
be interrupted when I&rsquo;m speaking, and to add that if you
break in upon me a third time, you and I shall
quarrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, proceed with your story,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I
will not interrupt you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said the jockey.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where was
I?&nbsp; Oh, with a set of people who had given up their minds to
shortening!&nbsp; Reducing the coin, though rather a lucrative,
was a very dangerous trade.&nbsp; Coin filed felt rough to the
touch; coin clipped could be easily detected by the eye; and as
for coin reduced by aquafortis, it was generally so discoloured
that, unless a great deal of pains was used to polish it, people
were apt to stare at it in a strange <a name="page247"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 247</span>manner, and to say: &lsquo;What have
they been doing to this here gold?&rsquo;&nbsp; My grandfather,
as I said before, was connected with a gang of shorters, and
sometimes shortened money, and at other times passed off what had
been shortened by other gentry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Passing off what had been shortened by others was his
ruin; for once, in trying to pass off a broad piece which had
been laid in aquafortis for four-and-twenty hours, and was very
black, not having been properly rectified, he was stopped and
searched, and other reduced coins being found about him, and in
his lodgings, he was committed to prison, tried and
executed.&nbsp; He was offered his life, provided he would betray
his comrades; but he told the big-wigs, who wanted him to do so,
that he would see them farther first, and died at Tyburn, amidst
the cheers of the populace, leaving my grandmother and father, to
whom he had always been a kind husband and parent&mdash;for,
setting aside the crime for which he suffered, he was a moral
man&mdash;leaving them, I say, to bewail his irreparable
loss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis said that misfortune never comes alone; this
is, however, not always the case.&nbsp; Shortly after my
grandfather&rsquo;s misfortune, as my grandmother and her son
were living in great misery in Spitalfields, her only
relation&mdash;a brother from whom she had been estranged some
years, on account of her marriage with my grandfather, who had
been in an inferior station to herself&mdash;died, leaving all
his property to her and the child.&nbsp; This property consisted
of a farm of about a hundred acres, with its stock, and some
money besides.&nbsp; My grandmother, who knew something of
business, instantly went into the country, where she farmed the
property for her own benefit and that of her son, to whom she
gave an education suitable to a person in his condition, till he
was old enough to manage the farm himself.&nbsp; Shortly after
the young man came of age, my grandmother died, and my father, in
about a year, married the daughter of a farmer, from whom he
expected some little fortune, but who very much deceived him,
becoming a bankrupt almost immediately after the marriage of his
daughter, and himself and family going to the workhouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother, however, made my father an excellent wife;
and if my father in the long run did not do well it was no fault
of hers.&nbsp; My father was not a bad man by nature; he was of
an easy, generous temper&mdash;the most unfortunate temper,
by-the-bye, for success in this life that any person can be
possessed of, as those who have it are almost sure to be made
dupes of by the designing.&nbsp; But, though easy and generous,
he was anything but a fool; he had a quick and witty tongue of
his own when <a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>he chose to exert it, and woe be to those who insulted
him openly, for there was not a better boxer in the whole country
round.&nbsp; My parents were married several years before I came
into the world, who was their first and only child.&nbsp; I may
be called an unfortunate creature; I was born with this beam or
scale on my left eye, which does not allow me to see with it; and
though I can see tolerably sharply with the other, indeed more
than most people can with both of theirs, it is a great
misfortune not to have two eyes like other people.&nbsp;
Moreover, setting aside the affair of my eye, I had a very ugly
countenance, my mouth being slightly wrung aside, and my
complexion rather swarthy.&nbsp; In fact, I looked so queer that
the gossips and neighbours, when they first saw me, swore I was a
changeling&mdash;perhaps it would have been well if I had never
been born; for my poor father, who had been particularly anxious
to have a son, no sooner saw me than he turned away, went to the
neighbouring town, and did not return for two days.&nbsp; I am by
no means certain that I was not the cause of his ruin, for till I
came into the world he was fond of his home, and attended much to
business, but afterwards he went frequently into company and did
not seem to care much about his affairs: he was, however, a kind
man, and when his wife gave him advice never struck her, nor do I
ever remember that he kicked me when I came in his way, or so
much as cursed my ugly face, though it was easy to see that he
didn&rsquo;t over-like me.&nbsp; When I was six years old I was
sent to the village school, where I was soon booked for a dunce,
because the master found it impossible to teach me either to read
or write.&nbsp; Before I had been at school two years, however, I
had beaten boys four years older than myself, and could fling a
stone with my left hand (for if I am right-eyed I am left-handed)
higher and farther than any one in the parish.&nbsp; Moreover, no
boy could equal me at riding, and no people ride so well or
desperately as boys.&nbsp; I could ride a donkey&mdash;a thing
far more difficult to ride than a horse&mdash;at full galop over
hedges and ditches, seated, or rather floating upon his hinder
part; so, though anything but clever, as this here Romany Rye
would say, I was yet able to do things which few other people
could do.&nbsp; By the time I was ten my father&rsquo;s affairs
had got into a very desperate condition, for he had taken to
gambling and horse-racing, and, being unsuccessful, had sold his
stock, mortgaged his estate, and incurred very serious
debts.&nbsp; The upshot was, that within a little time all he had
was seized, himself imprisoned, and my mother and myself put into
a cottage belonging to the parish, which, being very cold and <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>damp, was
the cause of her catching a fever, which speedily carried her
off.&nbsp; I was then bound apprentice to a farmer, in whose
service I underwent much coarse treatment, cold and hunger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After lying in prison near two years, my father was
liberated by an Act for the benefit of insolvent debtors; he was
then lost sight of for some time; at last, however, he made his
appearance in the neighbourhood dressed like a gentleman, and
seemingly possessed of plenty of money.&nbsp; He came to see me,
took me into a field, and asked me how I was getting on.&nbsp; I
told him I was dreadfully used, and begged him to take me away
with him; he refused, and told me to be satisfied with my
condition, for that he could do nothing for me.&nbsp; I had a
great love for my father, and likewise a great admiration for him
on account of his character as a boxer, the only character which
boys in general regard, so I wished much to be with him,
independently of the dog&rsquo;s life I was leading where I was;
I therefore said if he would not take me with him, I would follow
him; he replied that I must do no such thing, for that if I did,
it would be my ruin.&nbsp; I asked him what he meant, but he made
no reply, only saying that he would go and speak to the
farmer.&nbsp; Then taking me with him, he went to the farmer, and
in a very civil manner said that he understood I had not been
very kindly treated by him, but he hoped that in future I should
be used better.&nbsp; The farmer answered in a surly tone, that I
had been only too well treated, for that I was a worthless young
scoundrel; high words ensued, and the farmer, forgetting the kind
of man he had to deal with, checked him with my grandsire&rsquo;s
misfortune, and said he deserved to be hanged like his
father.&nbsp; In a moment my father knocked him down, and on his
getting up, gave him a terrible beating, then taking me by the
hand he hastened away; as we were going down a lane he said we
were now both done for.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care a straw
for that, father,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;provided I be with
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; My father took me to the neighbouring town, and
going into the yard of a small inn, he ordered out a pony and
light cart which belonged to him, then paying his bill, he told
me to mount upon the seat, and getting up drove away like
lightning; we drove for at least six hours without stopping, till
we came to a cottage by the side of a heath; we put the pony and
cart into a shed, and went into the cottage, my father unlocking
the door with a key which he took out of his pocket; there was
nobody in the cottage when we arrived, but shortly after there
came a man and woman, and then some more people, and by ten
o&rsquo;clock at night there were a dozen of <a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>us in the
cottage.&nbsp; The people were companions of my father.&nbsp; My
father began talking to them in Latin, but I did not understand
much of the discourse, though I believe it was about myself, as
their eyes were frequently turned to me.&nbsp; Some objections
appeared to be made to what he said; however, all at last seemed
to be settled, and we all sat down to some food.&nbsp; After
that, all the people got up and went away, with the exception of
the woman, who remained with my father and me.&nbsp; The next day
my father also departed, leaving me with the woman, telling me
before he went that she would teach me some things which it
behoved me to know.&nbsp; I remained with her in the cottage
upwards of a week; several of those who had been there coming and
going.&nbsp; The woman, after making me take an oath to be
faithful, told me that the people whom I had seen were a gang who
got their livelihood by passing forged notes, and that my father
was a principal man amongst them, adding that I must do my best
to assist them.&nbsp; I was a poor ignorant child at that time,
and I made no objection, thinking that whatever my father did
must be right; the woman then gave me some instructions in the
smasher&rsquo;s dialect of the Latin language.&nbsp; I made great
progress, because, for the first time in my life, I paid great
attention to my lessons.&nbsp; At last my father returned, and,
after some conversation with the woman, took me away in his
cart.&nbsp; I shall be very short about what happened to my
father and myself during two years.&nbsp; My father did his best
to smash the Bank of England by passing forged notes, and I did
my best to assist him.&nbsp; We attended races and fairs in all
kinds of disguises; my father was a first-rate hand at a
disguise, and could appear of all ages, from twenty to fourscore;
he was, however, grabbed at last.&nbsp; He had said, as I have
told you, that he should be my ruin, but I was the cause of his,
and all owing to the misfortune of this here eye of mine.&nbsp;
We came to this very place of Horncastle, where my father
purchased two horses of a young man, paying for them with three
forged notes purporting to be Bank of Englanders of fifty pounds
each, and got the young man to change another of the like amount;
he at that time appeared as a respectable dealer and I as his
son, as I really was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as we had got the horses we conveyed them to
one of the places of call belonging to our gang, of which there
were several.&nbsp; There they were delivered into the hands of
one of our companions, who speedily sold them in a distant part
of the country.&nbsp; The sum which they fetched&mdash;for the
gang kept very regular <a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>accounts&mdash;formed an important
item on the next day of sharing, of which there were twelve in
the year.&nbsp; The young man, whom my father had paid for the
horses with his smashing notes, was soon in trouble about them,
and ran some risk, as I heard, of being executed; but he bore a
good character, told a plain story, and, above all, had friends,
and was admitted to bail; to one of his friends he described my
father and myself.&nbsp; This person happened to be at an inn in
Yorkshire, where my father, disguised as a Quaker, attempted to
pass a forged note.&nbsp; The note was shown to this individual,
who pronounced it a forgery, it being exactly similar to those
for which the young man had been in trouble, and which he had
seen.&nbsp; My father, however, being supposed a respectable man,
because he was dressed as a Quaker&mdash;the very reason,
by-the-bye why anybody who knew aught of the Quakers would have
suspected him to be a rogue&mdash;would have been let go, had I
not made my appearance, dressed as his footboy.&nbsp; The friend
of the young man looked at my eye, and seized hold of my father,
who made a desperate resistance, I assisting him as in duty
bound.&nbsp; Being, however, overpowered by numbers, he bade me
by a look, and a word or two in Latin, to make myself
scarce.&nbsp; Though my heart was fit to break, I obeyed my
father, who was speedily committed.&nbsp; I followed him to the
county town in which he was lodged, where shortly after I saw him
tried, convicted and condemned.&nbsp; I then, having made friends
with the jailor&rsquo;s wife, visited him in his cell, where I
found him very much cast down.&nbsp; He said, that my mother had
appeared to him in a dream, and talked to him about a
resurrection and Christ Jesus; there was a Bible before him, and
he told me the chaplain had just been praying with him.&nbsp; He
reproached himself much, saying, he was afraid he had been my
ruin, by teaching me bad habits.&nbsp; I told him not to say any
such thing, for that I had been the cause of his, owing to the
misfortune of my eye.&nbsp; He begged me to give over all
unlawful pursuits, saying, that if persisted in, they were sure
of bringing a person to destruction.&nbsp; I advised him to try
and make his escape, proposing that when the turnkey came to let
me out, he should knock him down, and fight his way out, offering
to assist him, showing him a small saw, with which one of our
companions, who was in the neighbourhood, had provided me, and
with which he could have cut through his fetters in five minutes;
but he told me he had no wish to escape, and was quite willing to
die.&nbsp; I was rather hard at that time; I am not very soft
now; and I felt rather ashamed of my father&rsquo;s want of what
I called spirit.&nbsp; He was not executed after all; for <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>the
chaplain, who was connected with a great family, stood his friend
and got his sentence commuted, as they call it, to
transportation; and in order to make the matter easy, he induced
my father to make some valuable disclosures with respect to the
smashers&rsquo; system.&nbsp; I confess that I would have been
hanged before I would have done so, after having reaped the
profit of it; that is, I think so now, seated comfortably in my
inn, with my bottle of champagne before me.&nbsp; He, however,
did not show himself carrion; he would not betray his companions,
who had behaved very handsomely to him, having given the son of a
lord, a great barrister, not a hundred-pound forged bill, but a
hundred hard guineas, to plead his cause, and another ten, to
induce him, after pleading, to put his hand to his breast, and
say that, upon his honour, he believed the prisoner at the bar to
be an honest and injured man.&nbsp; No; I am glad to be able to
say, that my father did not show himself exactly carrion, though
I could almost have wished he had let himself&mdash;&nbsp;
However, I am here with my bottle of champagne and the Romany
Rye, and he was in his cell, with bread and water and the prison
chaplain.&nbsp; He took an affectionate leave of me before he was
sent away, giving me three out of five guineas, all the money he
had left.&nbsp; He was a kind man, but not exactly fitted to fill
my grandfather&rsquo;s shoes.&nbsp; I afterwards learned that he
died of fever, as he was being carried across the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the &rsquo;sizes I had made acquaintance with
old Fulcher.&nbsp; I was in the town on my father&rsquo;s
account, and he was there on his son&rsquo;s, who, having
committed a small larceny, was in trouble.&nbsp; Young Fulcher,
however, unlike my father, got off, though he did not give the
son of a lord a hundred guineas to speak for him, and ten more to
pledge his sacred honour for his honesty, but gave Counsellor
P&mdash; one-and-twenty shillings to defend him, who so
frightened the principal evidence, a plain honest farming-man,
that he flatly contradicted what he had first said, and at last
acknowledged himself to be all the rogues in the world, and,
amongst other things, a perjured villain.&nbsp; Old Fulcher,
before he left the town with his son,&mdash;and here it will be
well to say that he and his son left it in a kind of triumph, the
base drummer of a militia regiment, to whom they had given half a
crown, beating his drum before them&mdash;old Fulcher I say,
asked me to go and visit him, telling me where, at such a time, I
might find him and his caravan and family; offering, if I thought
fit, to teach me basket-making: so, after my father had been sent
off, I went and found up old Fulcher, and became his apprentice
in the basket-making <a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>line.&nbsp; I stayed with him till
the time of his death, which happened in about three months,
travelling about with him and his family, and living in green
lanes, where we saw gypsies and trampers, and all kinds of
strange characters.&nbsp; Old Fulcher, besides being an
industrious basket-maker, was an out and out thief, as was also
his son, and, indeed, every member of his family.&nbsp; They used
to make baskets during the day, and thieve during a great part of
the night.&nbsp; I had not been with them twelve hours, before
old Fulcher told me that I must thieve as well as the rest.&nbsp;
I demurred at first, for I remembered the fate of my father, and
what he had told me about leaving off bad courses, but soon
allowed myself to be over-persuaded, more especially as the first
robbery I was asked to do was a fruit robbery.&nbsp; I was to go
with young Fulcher, and steal some fine Morell cherries, which
grew against a wall in a gentleman&rsquo;s garden; so young
Fulcher and I went and stole the cherries, one half of which we
ate, and gave the rest to the old man, who sold them to a
fruiterer ten miles off from the place where we had stolen
them.&nbsp; The next night old Fulcher took me out with
himself.&nbsp; He was a great thief, though in a small way.&nbsp;
He used to say, that they were fools, who did not always manage
to keep the rope below their shoulders, by which he meant, that
it was not advisable to commit a robbery, or do anything which
could bring you to the gallows.&nbsp; He was all for petty
larceny, and knew where to put his hand upon any little thing in
England, which it was possible to steal.&nbsp; I submit it to the
better judgment of the Romany Rye, who I see is a great hand for
words and names, whether he ought not to have been called old
Filcher, instead of Fulcher.&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t give a regular
account of the larcenies which he committed during the short time
I knew him, either alone by himself, or with me and his
son.&nbsp; I shall merely relate the last:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A melancholy gentleman, who lived a very solitary life,
had a large carp in a shady pond in a meadow close to his house;
he was exceedingly fond of it, and used to feed it with his own
hand, the creature being so tame that it would put its snout out
of the water to be fed when it was whistled to; feeding and
looking at his carp were the only pleasures the poor melancholy
gentleman possessed.&nbsp; Old Fulcher&mdash;being in the
neighbourhood, and having an order from a fishmonger for a large
fish, which was wanted at a great city dinner, at which His
Majesty was to be present&mdash;swore he would steal the carp,
and asked me to go with him.&nbsp; I had heard of the
gentleman&rsquo;s fondness for his creature, and begged him to
let it be, advising him to go and steal some other <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>fish; but
old Fulcher swore, and said he would have the carp, although its
master should hang himself; I told him he might go by himself,
but he took his son and stole the carp, which weighed seventeen
pounds.&nbsp; Old Fulcher got thirty shillings for the carp,
which I afterwards heard was much admired and relished by His
Majesty.&nbsp; The master, however, of the carp, on losing his
favourite, became more melancholy than ever, and in a little time
hanged himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s sport for one, is death
to another,&rsquo; I once heard at the village school read out of
a copy-book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was the last larceny old Fulcher ever
committed.&nbsp; He could keep his neck always out of the noose,
but he could not always keep his leg out of the trap.&nbsp; A few
nights after, having removed to a distance, he went to an osier
car in order to steal some osiers for his basket-making, for he
never bought any.&nbsp; I followed a little way behind.&nbsp; Old
Fulcher had frequently stolen osiers out of the car, whilst in
the neighbourhood, but during his absence the property, of which
the car was a part, had been let to a young gentleman, a great
hand for preserving game.&nbsp; Old Fulcher had not got far into
the car before he put his foot into a man-trap.&nbsp; Hearing old
Fulcher shriek, I ran up, and found him in a dreadful
condition.&nbsp; Putting a large stick which I carried into the
jaws of the trap, I contrived to prize them open, and get old
Fulcher&rsquo;s leg out, but the leg was broken.&nbsp; So I ran
to the caravan, and told young Fulcher of what had happened, and
he and I went and helped his father home.&nbsp; A doctor was sent
for, who said it was necessary to take the leg off, but old
Fulcher, being very much afraid of pain, said it should not be
taken off, and the doctor went away, but after some days, old
Fulcher becoming worse, ordered the doctor to be sent for, who
came and took off his leg, but it was then too late,
mortification had come on, and in a little time old Fulcher
died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus perished old Fulcher; he was succeeded in his
business by his son, young Fulcher, who, immediately after the
death of his father, was called old Fulcher, it being our English
custom to call everybody old, as soon as their fathers are
buried; young Fulcher&mdash;I mean he who had been called young,
but was now old Fulcher&mdash;wanted me to go out and commit
larcenies with him; but I told him that I would have nothing more
to do with thieving, having seen the ill effects of it, and that
I should leave them in the morning.&nbsp; Old Fulcher begged me
to think better of it, and his mother joined with him.&nbsp; They
offered, if I would stay, to give me Mary Fulcher as a mort, till
she and I were old enough to be regularly married, she being the
daughter of the one, and <a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>the sister of the other.&nbsp; I
liked the girl very well, for she had always been civil to me,
and had a fair complexion and nice red hair, both of which I
like, being a bit of a black myself; but I refused, being
determined to see something more of the world than I could hope
to do with the Fulchers, and moreover, to live honestly, which I
could never do along with them.&nbsp; So the next morning I left
them: I was, as I said before, quite determined upon an honest
livelihood, and I soon found one.&nbsp; He is a great fool who is
ever dishonest in England.&nbsp; Any person who has any natural
gift, and everybody has some natural gift, is sure of finding
encouragement in this noble country of ours, provided he will but
exhibit it.&nbsp; I had not walked more than three miles before I
came to a wonderfully high church steeple, which stood close by
the road; I looked at the steeple, and going to a heap of smooth
pebbles which lay by the roadside, I took up some, and then went
into the churchyard, and placing myself just below the tower, my
right foot resting on a ledge, about two feet from the ground, I,
with my left hand&mdash;being a left-handed person, do you
see&mdash;flung or chucked up a stone, which lighting on the top
of the steeple, which was at least a hundred and fifty feet high,
did there remain.&nbsp; After repeating this feat two or three
times, I &lsquo;hulled&rsquo; up a stone, which went clean over
the tower, and then one, my right foot still on the ledge, which
rising at least five yards above the steeple, did fall down just
at my feet.&nbsp; Without knowing it, I was showing off my gift
to others besides myself, doing what, perhaps, not five men in
England could do.&nbsp; Two men, who were passing by, stopped and
looked at my proceedings, and when I had done flinging came into
the churchyard, and, after paying me a compliment on what they
had seen me do, proposed that I should join company with them; I
asked them who they were, and they told me.&nbsp; The one was
Hopping Ned, and the other Biting Giles.&nbsp; Both had their
gifts, by which they got their livelihood; Ned could hop a
hundred yards with any man in England, and Giles could lift up
with his teeth any dresser or kitchen table in the country, and,
standing erect, hold it dangling in his jaws.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
many a big oak table and dresser in certain districts of England,
which bear the marks of Giles&rsquo;s teeth; and I make no doubt
that, a hundred or two years hence, there&rsquo;ll be strange
stories about those marks, and that people will point them out as
a proof that there were giants in bygone time, and that many a
dentist will moralise on the decays which human teeth have
undergone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wanted me to go about with them, and exhibit my
gift occasionally as they did theirs, promising that the money
that was <a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>got by the exhibitions should be honestly
divided.&nbsp; I consented, and we set off together, and that
evening coming to a village, and putting up at the ale-house, all
the grand folks of the village being there smoking their pipes,
we contrived to introduce the subject of hopping&mdash;the upshot
being that Ned hopped against the school-master for a pound, and
beat him hollow; shortly after, Giles, for a wager, took up the
kitchen table in his jaws, though he had to pay a shilling to the
landlady for the marks he left, whose grandchildren will perhaps
get money by exhibiting them.&nbsp; As for myself, I did nothing
that day, but the next, on which my companions did nothing, I
showed off at hulling stones against a cripple, the crack man for
stone throwing, of a small town, a few miles farther on.&nbsp;
Bets were made to the tune of some pounds; I contrived to beat
the cripple, and just contrived; for to do him justice, I must
acknowledge he was a first-rate hand at stones, though he had a
game hip, and went sideways; his head, when he walked&mdash;if
his movements could be called walking&mdash;not being above three
feet above the ground.&nbsp; So we travelled, I and my
companions, showing off our gifts, Giles and I occasionally for a
gathering, but Ned never hopping unless against somebody for a
wager.&nbsp; We lived honestly and comfortably, making no little
money by our natural endowments, and were known over a great part
of England as &lsquo;Hopping Ned,&rsquo; &lsquo;Biting
Giles,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Hull over the Head Jack,&rsquo; which
was my name, it being the blackguard fashion of the English, do
you see, to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here I interrupted the jockey.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may call it a
blackguard fashion,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I dare say it is,
or it would scarcely be English; but it is an immensely ancient
one, and is handed down to us from our northern ancestry,
especially the Danes, who were in the habit of giving people
surnames, or rather nicknames, from some quality of body or mind,
but generally from some disadvantageous peculiarity of feature;
for there is no denying that the English, Norse, or whatever we
may please to call them, are an envious, depreciatory set of
people, who not only give their poor comrades contemptuous
surnames, but their great people also.&nbsp; They didn&rsquo;t
call you the matchless Hurler, because, by doing so, they would
have paid you a compliment, but Hull-over-the-Head Jack, as much
as to say that after all you were a scrub: so, in ancient time,
instead of calling Regner the great conqueror, the Nation Tamer,
they surnamed him Lodbrog, which signifies Rough or Hairy
Breeks&mdash;lod or loddin signifying rough or hairy; and instead
of complimenting Halgerdr, the wife of Gunnar of Hlitharend, the
great champion of Iceland, upon her majestic presence, by <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>calling her
Halgerdr, the stately or tall, what must they do but term her
Ha-brokr, or High-breeks, it being the fashion in old times for
Northern ladies to wear breeks, or breeches, which English ladies
of the present day never think of doing; and just, as of old,
they called Halgerdr Long-breeks, so this very day a fellow of
Horncastle called, in my hearing, our noble-looking Hungarian
friend here, Long-stockings.&nbsp; Oh, I could give you a hundred
instances, both ancient and modern, of this unseemly propensity
of our illustrious race, though I will only trouble you with a
few more ancient ones; they not only nicknamed Regner, but his
sons also, who were all kings, and distinguished men; one, whose
name was Biorn, they nicknamed Ironsides; another, Sigurd, Snake
in the Eye; another, White Sark, or White Shirt&mdash;I wonder
they did not call him Dirty Shirt; and Ivarr, another, who was
king of Northumberland, they called Beinlausi, or the Legless,
because he was spindle-shanked, had no sap in his bones, and
consequently no children.&nbsp; He was a great king, it is true,
and very wise, nevertheless his blackguard countrymen, always
averse, as their descendants are, to give credit to anybody, for
any valuable quality or possession, must needs lay hold, do you
see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But before I could say any more, the jockey, having laid down
his pipe, rose, and having taken off his coat, advanced towards
me.</p>
<h2><a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>CHAPTER XLII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> jockey, having taken off his
coat and advanced towards me, as I have stated in the preceding
chapter, exclaimed, in an angry tone: &ldquo;This is the third
time you have interrupted me in my tale, Mr. Rye; I passed over
the two first times with a simple warning, but you will now
please to get up and give me the satisfaction of a
man&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am really sorry,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if I have
given you offence, but you were talking of our English habit of
bestowing nicknames, and I could not refrain from giving a few
examples tending to prove what a very ancient habit it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you interrupted me,&rdquo; said the jockey,
&ldquo;and put me out of my tale, which you had no right to do;
and as for your examples, how do you know that I wasn&rsquo;t
going to give some as old or older than yourn?&nbsp; Now, stand
up, and I&rsquo;ll make an example of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I confess it was wrong in
me to interrupt you, and I ask your pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said the jockey,
&ldquo;asking pardon won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said I, getting up, &ldquo;if asking pardon
does not satisfy you, you are a different man from what I
considered you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But here the Hungarian, also getting up, interposed his tall
form and pipe between us, saying in English, scarcely
intelligible, &ldquo;Let there be no dispute!&nbsp; As for
myself, I am very much obliged to the young man of Horncastle for
his interruption, though he has told me that one of his dirty
townsmen called me &lsquo;Longstockings&rsquo;.&nbsp; By Isten!
there is more learning in what he has just said than in all the
<i>verdammt</i> English histories of Thor and Tzernebock I ever
read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I care nothing for his learning,&rdquo; said the
jockey.&nbsp; &ldquo;I consider myself as good a man as he, for
all his learning; so stand out of the way, Mr. Sixfoot-eleven
or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do no such thing,&rdquo; said the
Hungarian.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder you are not ashamed of
yourself.&nbsp; You ask a young man to drink champagne with you,
you make him dronk, he interrupt you with very good sense; he ask
your pardon, yet you not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the jockey, &ldquo;I am
satisfied.&nbsp; I am rather a <a name="page259"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>short-tempered person, but I bear no
malice.&nbsp; He is, as you say, drinking my wine, and has
perhaps taken a drop too much, not being used to such high
liquor; but one doesn&rsquo;t like to be put out of one&rsquo;s
tale, more especially when one was about to moralise, do you see,
oneself, and to show off what little learning one has.&nbsp;
However, I bears no malice.&nbsp; Here is a hand to each of you;
we&rsquo;ll take another glass each, and think no more about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The jockey having shaken both of our hands, and filled our
glasses and his own with what champagne remained in the bottle,
put on his coat, sat down, and resumed his pipe and story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was I?&nbsp; Oh, roaming about the country with
Hopping Ned and Biting Giles.&nbsp; Those were happy days, and a
merry and prosperous life we led.&nbsp; However, nothing
continues under the sun in the same state in which it begins, and
our firm was soon destined to undergo a change.&nbsp; We came to
a village where there was a very high church steeple, and in a
little time my comrades induced a crowd of people to go and see
me display my gift by flinging stones above the heads of Matthew,
Mark, Luke and John, who stood at the four corners on the top,
carved in stone.&nbsp; The parson, seeing the crowd, came
waddling out of his rectory to see what was going on.&nbsp; After
I had flung up the stones, letting them fall just where I
liked&mdash;and one, I remember fell on the head of Mark, where I
daresay it remains to the present day&mdash;the parson, who was
one of the description of people called philosophers, held up his
hand, and asked me to let the next stone I flung up fall into
it.&nbsp; He wished, do you see, to know with what weight the
stone would fall down, and talked something about
gravitation&mdash;a word which I could never understand to the
present day, save that it turned out a grave matter to me.&nbsp;
I, like a silly fellow myself, must needs consent, and, flinging
the stone up to a vast height, contrived so that it fell into the
parson&rsquo;s hand, which it cut dreadfully.&nbsp; The parson
flew into a great rage, more particularly as everybody laughed at
him, and, being a magistrate, ordered his clerk, who was likewise
constable, to conduct me to prison as a rogue and vagabond,
telling my comrades that if they did not take themselves off, he
would serve them in the same manner.&nbsp; So Ned hopped off, and
Giles ran after him, without making any gathering, and I was led
to Bridewell, my mittimus following at the end of a week, the
parson&rsquo;s hand not permitting him to write before that
time.&nbsp; In the Bridewell I remained a month, when, being
dismissed, I went in quest of my companions, whom, after some
time, I found up, but they refused to keep my company any longer,
telling me <a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>that I was a dangerous character, likely to bring them
more trouble than profit; they had, moreover, filled up my
place.&nbsp; Going into a cottage to ask for a drink of water,
they saw a country fellow making faces to amuse his children; the
faces were so wonderful that Hopping Ned and Biting Giles at once
proposed taking him into partnership, and the man&mdash;who was a
fellow not very fond of work&mdash;after a little entreaty, went
away with them.&nbsp; I saw him exhibit his gift, and
couldn&rsquo;t blame the others for preferring him to me; he was
a proper ugly fellow at all times, but when he made faces his
countenance was like nothing human.&nbsp; He was called Ugly
Moses.&nbsp; I was so amazed at his faces, that though poor
myself I gave him sixpence, which I have never grudged to this
day, for I never saw anything like them.&nbsp; The firm throve
wonderfully after he had been admitted into it.&nbsp; He died
some little time ago, keeper of a public-house, which he had been
enabled to take from the profits of his faces.&nbsp; A son of
his, one of the children he was making faces to when my comrades
entered his door, is at present a barrister, and a very rising
one.&nbsp; He has his gift&mdash;he has not, it is true, the gift
of the gab, but he has something better, he was born with a grin
on his face, a quiet grin; he would not have done to grin through
a collar like his father, and would never have been taken up by
Hopping Ned and Biting Giles, but that grin of his caused him to
be noticed by a much greater person than either; an attorney
observing it took a liking to the lad, and prophesied that he
would some day be heard of in the world; and in order to give him
the first lift, took him into his office, at first to light fires
and do such kind of work, and after a little time taught him to
write, then promoted him to a desk, articled him afterwards, and
being unmarried, and without children, left him what he had when
he died.&nbsp; The young fellow, after practising at the law some
time, went to the bar, where, in a few years, helped on by his
grin, for he had nothing else to recommend him, he became, as I
said before, a rising barrister.&nbsp; He comes our circuit, and
I occasionally employ him, when I am obliged to go to law about
such a thing as an unsound horse.&nbsp; He generally brings me
through&mdash;or rather that grin of his does&mdash;and yet I
don&rsquo;t like the fellow, confound him, but I&rsquo;m an
oddity&mdash;no, the one I like, and whom I generally employ, is
a fellow quite different, a bluff sturdy dog, with no grin on his
face but with a look which seems to say I am an honest man, and
what cares I for anyone?&nbsp; And an honest man he is, and
something more.&nbsp; I have known coves with a better gift of
the gab, though not many, but he always speaks to the purpose,
and <a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>understands law thoroughly; and that&rsquo;s not
all.&nbsp; When at college, for he has been at college, he
carried off everything before him as a Latiner, and was
first-rate at a game they call matthew mattocks.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know exactly what it is, but I have heard that he who
is first-rate at matthew mattocks is thought more of than if he
were first-rate Latiner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the chap that I&rsquo;m talking about, not only
came out first-rate Latiner, but first-rate at matthew mattocks
too, doing, in fact, as I am told by those who knows, for I was
never at college myself, what no one had ever done before.&nbsp;
Well, he makes his appearance at our circuit, does very well, of
course, but he has a somewhat high front, as becomes an honest
man, and one who has beat every one at Latin and matthew
mattocks; and who can speak first-rate law and sense; but see
now, the cove with the grin, who has like myself never been at
college, knows nothing of Latin, or matthew mattocks, and has no
particular gift of the gab, has two briefs for his one, and I
suppose very properly, for that grin of his curries favour with
the juries; and mark me, that grin of his will enable him to beat
the other in the long run.&nbsp; We all know what all barrister
coves looks forward to&mdash;a seat on the hop sack.&nbsp; Well,
I&rsquo;ll bet a bull to fivepence that the grinner gets upon it,
and the snarler doesn&rsquo;t; at any rate, that he gets there
first.&nbsp; I calls my cove&mdash;for he is my cove&mdash;a
snarler; because your first-rates at matthew mattocks are called
snarlers, and for no other reason; for the chap, though with a
high front, is a good chap, and once drank a glass of ale with
me, after buying an animal out of my stable.&nbsp; I have often
thought it a pity he wasn&rsquo;t born with a grin on his face
like the son of Ugly <i>Moses</i>.&nbsp; It is true he would
scarcely then have been an out and outer at Latin and matthew
mattocks, but what need of either to a chap born with a
grin?&nbsp; Talk of being born with a silver spoon in one&rsquo;s
mouth! give me a cove born with a grin on his face&mdash;a much
better endowment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will now shorten my history as much as I can, for we
have talked as much as folks do during a whole night in the
Commons&rsquo; House, though, of course, not with so much
learning, or so much to the purpose, because&mdash;why?&nbsp;
They are in the House of Commons, and we in a public room of an
inn at Horncastle.&nbsp; The goodness of the ale, do ye see,
never depending on what it is made of, oh, no! but on the fashion
and appearance of the jug in which it is served up.&nbsp; After
being turned out of the firm, I got my living in two or three
honest ways, which I shall not trouble you with describing.&nbsp;
I did not like any of them, however, <a name="page262"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 262</span>as they did not exactly suit my
humour; at last I found one which did.&nbsp; One Saturday
forenoon, I chanced to be in the cattle-market of a place about
eighty miles from here; there I won the favour of an old
gentleman who sold dickeys.&nbsp; He had a very shabby squad of
animals, without soul or spirit; nobody would buy them, till I
leaped upon their hinder ends, and by merely wriggling in a
particular manner, made them caper and bound so to people&rsquo;s
liking, that in a few hours every one of them was sold at very
sufficient prices.&nbsp; The old gentleman was so pleased with my
skill, that he took me home with him, and in a very little time
into partnership.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a good thing to have a gift,
but yet better to have two.&nbsp; I might have got a very decent
livelihood by throwing stones, but I much question whether I
should ever have attained to the position in society which I now
occupy, but for my knowledge of animals.&nbsp; I lived very
comfortably with the old gentleman till he died, which he did
about a fortnight after he had laid his old lady in the
ground.&nbsp; Having no children, he left me what should remain
after he had been buried decently, and the remainder was six
dickeys and thirty shillings in silver.&nbsp; I remained in the
dickey trade ten years, during which time I saved a hundred
pounds.&nbsp; I then embarked in the horse line.&nbsp; One day,
being in the &mdash; market on a Saturday, I saw Mary Fulcher
with a halter round her neck, led about by a man, who offered to
sell her for eighteenpence.&nbsp; I took out the money forthwith
and bought her; the man was her husband, a basket-maker, with
whom she had lived several years without having any children; he
was a drunken, quarrelsome fellow, and having had a dispute with
her the day before, he determined to get rid of her, by putting a
halter round her neck and leading her to the cattle-market, as if
she were a mare, which he had, it seems, a right to do, all women
being considered mares by old English law, and, indeed still
called mares in certain counties, where genuine old English is
still preserved.&nbsp; That same afternoon, the man who had been
her husband, having got drunk in a public-house, with the money
which he had received for her, quarrelled with another man, and
receiving a blow under the ear, fell upon the floor, and died of
artiflex; and in less than three weeks I was married to Mary
Fulcher, by virtue of regular banns.&nbsp; I am told she was
legally my property by virtue of my having bought her with a
halter round her neck; but, to tell you the truth, I think
everybody should live by his trade, and I didn&rsquo;t wish to
act shabbily towards our parson, who is a good fellow, and has
certainly a right to his fees.&nbsp; A better wife than Mary
Fulcher&mdash;I mean Mary <a name="page263"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 263</span>Dale&mdash;no one ever had; she has
borne me several children, and has at all times shown a
willingness to oblige me, and to be my faithful wife.&nbsp;
Amongst other things, I begged her to have done with her family,
and I believe she has never spoken to them since.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have thriven very well in business, and my name is up
as being a person who can be depended on, when folks treats me
handsomely.&nbsp; I always make a point when a gentleman comes to
me, and says, &lsquo;Mr. Dale&rsquo; or &lsquo;John,&rsquo; for I
have no objection to be called John by a gentleman&mdash;&lsquo;I
wants a good horse, and I am ready to pay a good
price&rsquo;&mdash;I always makes a point, I say, to furnish him
with an animal worth the money; but when I sees a fellow, whether
he calls himself gentleman or not, wishing to circumvent me what
does I do?&nbsp; I doesn&rsquo;t quarrel with him; not I; but,
letting him imagine he is taking me in, I contrives to sell him a
screw for thirty pounds, not worth thirty shillings.&nbsp; All
honest, respectable people have at present great confidence in
me, and frequently commissions me to buy them horses at great
fairs like this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This short young gentleman was recommended to me by a
great landed proprietor, to whom he bore letters of
recommendation from some great prince in his own country, who had
a long time ago been entertained at the house of the landed
proprietor, and the consequence is, that I brings young six foot
six to Horncastle, and purchases for him the horse of the Romany
Rye.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t do these kind things for nothing, it is
true; that can&rsquo;t be expected, for every one must live by
his trade; but, as I said before, when I am treated handsomely, I
treat folks so.&nbsp; Honesty, I have discovered, as perhaps some
other people have, is by far the best policy; though, as I also
said before, when I&rsquo;m along with thieves, I can beat them
at their own game.&nbsp; If I am obliged to do it, I can pass off
the veriest screw as a flying drummedary, for even when I was a
child I had found out by various means what may be done with
animals.&nbsp; I wish now to ask a civil question, Mr. Romany
Rye.&nbsp; Certain folks have told me that you are a horse witch;
are you one, or are you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, like yourself,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;know, to a
certain extent, what may be done with animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how would you, Mr. Romany Rye, pass off the
veriest screw in the world for a flying drummedary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By putting a small live eel down his throat; as long as
the eel remained in his stomach, the horse would appear brisk and
lively in a surprising degree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how would you contrive to make a regular kicker <a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>and biter
appear so tame and gentle, that any respectable fat old gentleman
of sixty, who wanted an easy goer, would be glad to purchase him
for fifty pounds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By pouring down his throat four pints of generous old
ale, which would make him so happy and comfortable, that he would
not have the heart to kick or bite anybody, for a season at
least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where did you learn all this?&rdquo; said the
jockey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have read about the eel in an old English book, and
about the making drunk in a Spanish novel, and, singularly
enough, I was told the same things by a wild blacksmith in
Ireland.&nbsp; Now tell me, do you bewitch horses in this
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; said the jockey; &ldquo;mercy upon us!&nbsp;
I wouldn&rsquo;t do such things for a hatful of money.&nbsp; No,
no, preserve me from live eels and hocussing!&nbsp; And now let
me ask you, how you would spirit a horse out of a
field?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would I spirit a horse out of a field?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; supposing you were down in the world, and had
determined on taking up the horse-stealing line of
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I should&mdash;&nbsp; But I tell you what, friend,
I see you are trying to pump me, and I tell you plainly that I
will hear something from you with respect to your art, before I
tell you anything more.&nbsp; Now, how would you whisper a horse
out of a field, provided you were down in the world, and so
forth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, ah, I see you are up to a game, Mr. Romany;
however, I am a gentleman in mind, if not by birth, and I scorn
to do the unhandsome thing to anybody who has dealt fairly
towards me.&nbsp; Now, you told me something I didn&rsquo;t know,
and I&rsquo;ll tell you something which perhaps you do
know.&nbsp; I whispers a horse out of a field in this way: I have
a mare in my stable; well, in the early season of the year I goes
into my stable&mdash;&nbsp; Well, I puts the sponge into a small
bottle which I keeps corked.&nbsp; I takes my bottle in my hand,
and goes into a field, suppose by night, where there is a very
fine stag horse.&nbsp; I manage with great difficulty to get
within ten yards of the horse, who stands staring at me just
ready to run away.&nbsp; I then uncorks my bottle, presses my
forefinger to the sponge, and holds it out to the horse, the
horse gives a sniff, then a start, and comes nearer.&nbsp; I
corks up my bottle and puts it into my pocket.&nbsp; My business
is done, for the next two hours the horse would follow me
anywhere&mdash;the difficulty, indeed, would be to get rid of
him.&nbsp; Now, is that your way of doing business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My way of doing business?&nbsp; Mercy upon us!&nbsp; I
wouldn&rsquo;t steal a horse in that way, or, indeed, in any way,
for all the money <a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span>in the world; however, let me tell you, for your
comfort, that a trick somewhat similar is described in the
history of Herodotus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the history of Herod&rsquo;s ass!&rdquo; said the
jockey; &ldquo;well, if I did write a book, it should be about
something more genteel than a dickey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not say Herod&rsquo;s ass,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;but Herodotus, a very genteel writer, I assure you, who
wrote a history about very genteel people, in a language no less
genteel than Greek, more than two thousand years ago.&nbsp; There
was a dispute as to who should be king amongst certain imperious
chieftains.&nbsp; At last they agreed to obey him whose horse
should neigh first on a certain day, in front of the royal
palace, before the rising of the sun; for you must know that they
did not worship the person who made the sun as we do, but the sun
itself.&nbsp; So one of these chieftains, talking over the matter
to his groom, and saying he wondered who would be king, the
fellow said: &lsquo;Why you, master, or I don&rsquo;t know much
about horses&rsquo;.&nbsp; So the day before the day of trial,
what does the groom do, but takes his master&rsquo;s horse before
the palace and introduce him to a mare in the stable, and then
lead him forth again.&nbsp; Well, early the next day all the
chieftains on their horses appeared in front of the palace before
the dawn of day.&nbsp; Not a horse neighed but one, and that was
the horse of him who had consulted with his groom, who, thinking
of the animal within the stable, gave such a neigh that all the
buildings rang.&nbsp; His rider was forthwith elected king, and a
brave king he was.&nbsp; So this shows what seemingly wonderful
things may be brought about by a little preparation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doth,&rdquo; said the jockey; &ldquo;what was the
chap&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name&mdash;his name&mdash;Darius
Hystaspes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the groom&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he made a good king?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First-rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only think! well, if he made a good king, what a
wonderful king the groom would have made, through whose knowledge
of &rsquo;orses he was put on the throne.&nbsp; And now another
question Mr. Romany Rye, have you particular words which have
power to soothe or aggravate horses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should ask me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;whether I have
horses that can be aggravated or soothed by particular
words.&nbsp; No words have any particular power over horses or
other animals who have never heard them before&mdash;how should
they?&nbsp; But certain animals connect ideas of misery or
enjoyment with particular words which <a name="page266"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 266</span>they are acquainted with.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll give you an example.&nbsp; I knew a cob in Ireland
that could be driven to a state of kicking madness by a
particular word, used by a particular person, in a particular
tone; but that word was connected with a very painful operation
which had been performed upon him by that individual, who had
frequently employed it at a certain period whilst the animal had
been under his treatment.&nbsp; The same cob could be soothed in
a moment by another word, used by the same individual in a very
different kind of tone; the word was <i>deaghblasda</i>, or sweet
tasted.&nbsp; Some time after the operation, whilst the cob was
yet under his hands, the fellow&mdash;who was what the Irish call
a fairy smith&mdash;had done all he could to soothe the creature,
and had at last succeeded by giving it gingerbread-buttons, of
which the cob became passionately fond.&nbsp; Invariably,
however, before giving it a button, he said,
&lsquo;<i>Deaghblasda</i>,&rsquo; with which word the cob by
degrees associated an idea of unmixed enjoyment: so if he could
rouse the cob to madness by the word which recalled the torture
to its remembrance, he could as easily soothe it by the other
word, which the cob knew would be instantly followed by the
button, which the smith never failed to give him after using the
word <i>deaghblasda</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing wonderful to be done,&rdquo; said the
jockey, &ldquo;without a good deal of preparation, as I know
myself.&nbsp; Folks stare and wonder at certain things which they
would only laugh at if they knew how they were done; and to prove
what I say is true, I will give you one or two examples.&nbsp;
Can either of you lend me a handkerchief?&nbsp; That won&rsquo;t
do,&rdquo; said he, as I presented him with a silk one.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I wish for a delicate white handkerchief.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s just the kind of thing,&rdquo; said he, as the
Hungarian offered him a fine white cambric handkerchief,
beautifully worked with gold at the hems; &ldquo;now you shall
see me set this handkerchief on fire.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him do so by any means,&rdquo; said the
Hungarian, speaking to me in German, &ldquo;it is the gift of a
lady whom I highly admire, and I would not have it burnt for the
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He has no occasion to be under any
apprehension,&rdquo; said the jockey, after I had interpreted to
him what the Hungarian had said, &ldquo;I will restore it to him
uninjured, or my name is not Jack Dale.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
sticking the handkerchief carelessly into the left side of his
bosom, he took the candle, which by this time had burnt very low,
and holding his head back, he applied the flame to the
handkerchief, which instantly seemed to catch fire.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What do you think of that?&rdquo; said he to the
Hungarian.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, that you have ruined me,&rdquo; said
the latter.&nbsp; &ldquo;No harm done, I assure you,&rdquo; said
the jockey, who presently, clapping <a name="page267"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 267</span>his hand on his bosom extinguished
the fire, and returned the handkerchief to the Hungarian, asking
him if it was burnt.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see no burn upon it,&rdquo;
said the Hungarian; &ldquo;but in the name of Gott, how could you
set it on fire without burning it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I never
set it on fire at all,&rdquo; said the jockey; &ldquo;I set this
on fire,&rdquo; showing us a piece of half-burnt calico.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I placed this calico above it, and lighted not the
handkerchief, but the rag.&nbsp; Now I will show you something
else.&nbsp; I have a magic shilling in my pocket, which I can
make run up along my arm.&nbsp; But, first of all, I would gladly
know whether either of you can do the like.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Thereupon the Hungarian and myself, putting our hands into our
pockets, took out shillings, and endeavoured to make them run up
our arms, but utterly failed; both shillings, after we had made
two or three attempts, falling to the ground.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
noncomposses you both are,&rdquo; said the jockey; and placing a
shilling on the end of the fingers of his right hand he made
strange faces to it, drawing back his head, whereupon the
shilling instantly began to run up his arm, occasionally hopping
and jumping as if it were bewitched, always endeavouring to make
towards the head of the jockey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I do that?&rdquo; said he, addressing himself to
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;I really do not know,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;unless it is by the motion of your arm.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The motion of my nonsense,&rdquo; said the jockey, and,
making a dreadful grimace, the shilling hopped upon his knee, and
began to run up his thigh and to climb up his breast.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How is that done?&rdquo; said he again.&nbsp; &ldquo;By
witchcraft, I suppose,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;There you are
right,&rdquo; said the jockey; &ldquo;by the witchcraft of one of
Miss Berners&rsquo; hairs; the end of one of her long hairs is
tied to that shilling by means of a hole in it, and the other end
goes round my neck by means of a loop; so that, when I draw back
my head, the shilling follows it.&nbsp; I suppose you wish to
know how I got the hair,&rdquo; said he, grinning at me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will tell you.&nbsp; I once, in the course of my
ridings, saw Miss Berners beneath a hedge, combing out her long
hair, and, being rather a modest kind of person, what must I do
but get off my horse, tie him to a gate, go up to her, and
endeavour to enter into conversation with her.&nbsp; After giving
her the sele of the day, and complimenting her on her hair, I
asked her to give me one of the threads; whereupon she gave me
such a look, and, calling me fellow, told me to take myself
off.&nbsp; &lsquo;I must have a hair first,&rsquo; said I, making
a snatch at one.&nbsp; I believe I hurt her; but, whether I did
or not, up she started, and, though her hair was unbound, gave me
the only drubbing I ever had in my life.&nbsp; Lor! <a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>how, with
her right hand, she fibbed me whilst she held me round the neck
with her left arm; I was soon glad to beg her pardon on my knees,
which she gave me in a moment, when she saw me in that condition,
being the most placable creature in the world, and not only her
pardon, but one of the hairs which I longed for, which I put
through a shilling, with which I have on evenings after fairs,
like this, frequently worked what seemed to those who looked on
downright witchcraft, but which is nothing more than pleasant
deception.&nbsp; And now, Mr. Romany Rye, to testify my regard
for you, I give you the shilling and the hair.&nbsp; I think you
have a kind of respect for Miss Berners; but whether you have or
not, keep them as long as you can, and whenever you look at them
think of the finest woman in England, and of John Dale, the
jockey of Horncastle.&nbsp; I believe I have told you my
history,&rdquo; said he&mdash;&ldquo;no, not quite; there is one
circumstance I had passed over.&nbsp; I told you that I have
thriven very well in business, and so I have, upon the whole: at
any rate, I find myself comfortably off now.&nbsp; I have horses,
money, and owe nobody a groat; at any rate, nothing but what I
could pay to-morrow.&nbsp; Yet I have had my dreary day, ay,
after I had obtained what I call a station in the world.&nbsp;
All of a sudden, about five years ago, everything seemed to go
wrong with me&mdash;horses became sick or died, people who owed
me money broke or ran away, my house caught fire, in fact,
everything went against me; and not from any mismanagement of my
own.&nbsp; I looked round for help, but&mdash;what do you
think?&mdash;nobody would help me.&nbsp; Somehow or other it had
got abroad that I was in difficulties, and everybody seemed
disposed to avoid me, as if I had got the plague.&nbsp; Those who
were always offering me help when I wanted none, now, when they
thought me in trouble, talked of arresting me.&nbsp; Yes; two
particular friends of mine, who had always been offering me their
purses when my own was stuffed full, now talked of arresting me,
though I only owed the scoundrels a hundred pounds each; and they
would have done so, provided I had not paid them what I owed
them; and how did I do that?&nbsp; Why, I was able to do it
because I found a friend&mdash;and who was that friend?&nbsp;
Why, a man who has since been hung, of whom everybody has heard,
and of whom everybody for the next hundred years will
occasionally talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day, whilst in trouble, I was visited by a person I
had occasionally met at sporting dinners.&nbsp; He came to look
after a Suffolk Punch, the best horse, by-the-bye, that anybody
can purchase to drive, it being the only animal of the horse kind
in England that will pull twice at a dead weight.&nbsp; I told
him that I <a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
269</span>had none at that time that I could recommend; in fact,
that every horse in my stable was sick.&nbsp; He then invited me
to dine with him at an inn close by, and I was glad to go with
him, in the hope of getting rid of unpleasant thoughts.&nbsp;
After dinner, during which he talked nothing but slang, observing
I looked very melancholy, he asked me what was the matter with
me, and I, my heart being opened by the wine he had made me
drink, told him my circumstances without reserve.&nbsp; With an
oath or two for not having treated him at first like a friend, he
said he would soon set me all right; and pulling out two hundred
pounds, told me to pay him when I could.&nbsp; I felt as I never
felt before; however, I took his notes, paid my sneaks, and in
less than three months was right again, and had returned him his
money.&nbsp; On paying it to him, I said that I had now a Punch
which would just suit him, saying that I would give it to
him&mdash;a free gift&mdash;for nothing.&nbsp; He swore at me,
telling me to keep my Punch, for that he was suited
already.&nbsp; I begged him to tell me how I could requite him
for his kindness, whereupon, with the most dreadful oath I ever
heard, he bade me come and see him hanged when his time was
come.&nbsp; I wrung his hand, and told him I would, and I kept my
word.&nbsp; The night before the day he was hanged at H&mdash;, I
harnessed a Suffolk Punch to my light gig, the same Punch which I
had offered to him, which I have ever since kept, and which
brought me and this short young man to Horncastle, and in eleven
hours I drove that Punch one hundred and ten miles.&nbsp; I
arrived at H&mdash; just in the nick of time.&nbsp; There was the
ugly jail, the scaffold, and there upon it stood the only friend
I ever had in the world.&nbsp; Driving my Punch, which was all in
a foam, into the midst of the crowd, which made way for me as if
it knew what I came for, I stood up in my gig, took off my hat,
and shouted: &lsquo;God Almighty bless you, Jack!&rsquo;&nbsp;
The dying man turned his pale grim face towards me&mdash;for his
face was always somewhat grim, do you see&mdash;nodded and said,
or I thought I heard him say: &lsquo;All right old
chap&rsquo;.&nbsp; The next moment&mdash;my eyes water.&nbsp; He
had a high heart, got into a scrape whilst in the marines, lost
his half-pay, took to the turf, ring, gambling, and at last cut
the throat of a villain who had robbed him of nearly all he
had.&nbsp; But he had good qualities, and I know for certain that
he never did half the bad things laid to his charge; for example,
he never bribed Tom Oliver to fight cross, as it was said he did
on the day of the awful thunder-storm.&nbsp; Ned Flatnose fairly
beat Tom Oliver, for though Ned was not what&rsquo;s called a
good fighter, he had a particular blow, which if he could put in
he was sure to win.&nbsp; His right shoulder, <a

was two inches farther back than it ought to have been, and
consequently his right fist generally fell short; but if he could
swing himself round, and put in a blow with that right arm, he
could kill or take away the senses of anybody in the world.&nbsp;
It was by putting in that blow in his second fight with Spring
that he beat noble Tom.&nbsp; Spring beat him like a sack in the
first battle, but in the second Ned Painter&mdash;for that was
his real name&mdash;contrived to put in his blow, and took the
senses out of Spring; and in like manner he took the senses out
of Tom Oliver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, some are born to be hanged, and some are not; and
many of those who are not hanged are much worse than those who
are.&nbsp; Jack, with many a good quality, is hanged, whilst that
fellow of a lord, who wanted to get the horse from you at about
two-thirds of his value, without a single good quality in the
world, is not hanged, and probably will remain so.&nbsp; You ask
the reason why, perhaps.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you; the lack of a
certain quality called courage, which Jack possessed in
abundance, will preserve him; from the love which he bears his
own neck he will do nothing which can bring him to the
gallows.&nbsp; In my rough way I&rsquo;ll draw their characters
from their childhood, and then ask whether Jack was not the best
character of the two.&nbsp; Jack was a rough, audacious boy, fond
of fighting, going a birds&rsquo;-nesting, but I never heard he
did anything particularly cruel save once, I believe, tying a
canister to a butcher&rsquo;s dog&rsquo;s tail; whilst this
fellow of a lord was by nature a savage beast, and when a boy
would in winter pluck poor fowls naked, and set them running on
the ice and in the snow, and was particularly fond of burning
cats alive in the fire.&nbsp; Jack, when a lad, gets a commission
on board a ship as an officer of horse marines, and in two or
three engagements behaves quite up to the mark&mdash;at least of
a marine, the marines having no particular character for courage,
you know&mdash;never having run to the guns and fired them like
madmen after the blue jackets had had more than enough.&nbsp; Oh,
dear me, no!&nbsp; My lord gets into the valorous British army,
where cowardice&mdash;oh, dear me!&mdash;is a thing almost
entirely unknown; and being on the field of Waterloo the day
before the battle, falls off his horse, and, pretending to be
hurt in the back, gets himself put on the sick list&mdash;a
pretty excuse&mdash;hurting his back&mdash;for not being present
at such a fight.&nbsp; Old Benbow, after part of both his legs
had been shot away in a sea-fight, made the carpenter make him a
cradle to hold his bloody stumps, and continued on deck, cheering
his men till he died.&nbsp; Jack returns home, and gets into
trouble, and having nothing to subsist by but his wits, gets his
living by the ring, and the turf, and gambling, doing <a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>many an odd
kind of thing, I dare say, but not half those laid to his
charge.&nbsp; My lord does much the same without the excuse for
doing so which Jack had, for he had plenty of means, is a leg,
and a black, only in a more polished way, and with more cunning,
and I may say success, having done many a rascally thing never
laid to his charge.&nbsp; Jack at last cuts the throat of a
villain who had cheated him of all he had in the world, and who,
I am told, was in many points the counterpart of this screw and
white feather, is taken up, tried, and executed; and certainly
taking away a man&rsquo;s life is a dreadful thing; but is there
nothing as bad?&nbsp; Whitefeather will cut no person&rsquo;s
throat&mdash;I will not say who has cheated him, for being a
cheat himself, he will take good care that nobody cheats him, but
he&rsquo;ll do something quite as bad; out of envy to a person
who never injured him, and whom he hates for being more clever
and respected than himself, he will do all he possibly can, by
backbiting and every unfair means, to do that person a mortal
injury.&nbsp; But Jack is hanged, and my lord is not.&nbsp; Is
that right?&nbsp; My wife, Mary Fulcher&mdash;I beg her pardon,
Mary Dale&mdash;who is a Methodist, and has heard the mighty
preacher, Peter Williams, says some people are preserved from
hanging by the grace of God.&nbsp; With her I differs, and says
it is from want of courage.&nbsp; This Whitefeather, with one
particle of Jack&rsquo;s courage, and with one tithe of his good
qualities, would have been hanged long ago, for he has ten times
Jack&rsquo;s malignity.&nbsp; Jack was hanged because, along with
his bad qualities, he had courage and generosity; this fellow is
not, because with all Jack&rsquo;s bad qualities, and many more,
amongst which is cunning, he has neither courage nor
generosity.&nbsp; Think of a fellow like that putting down two
hundred pounds to relieve a distressed fellow-creature; why he
would rob, but for the law and the fear it fills him with, a
workhouse child of its breakfast, as the saying is&mdash;and has
been heard to say that he would not trust his own father for
sixpence, and he can&rsquo;t imagine why such a thing as credit
should be ever given.&nbsp; I never heard a person give him a
good word&mdash;stay, stay, yes!&nbsp; I once heard an old
parson, to whom I sold a Punch, say that he had the art of
receiving company gracefully and dismissing them without
refreshment.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t wish to be too hard with him,
and so let him make the most of that compliment.&nbsp; Well! he
manages to get on, whilst Jack is hanged; not quite enviably,
however; he has had his rubs, and pretty hard
ones&mdash;everybody knows he slunk from Waterloo, and
occasionally checks him with so doing; whilst he has been
rejected by a woman&mdash;what a mortification to the low pride
of which the scoundrel has plenty!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a song
about both circumstances, <a name="page272"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 272</span>which may, perhaps, ring in his ears
on a dying bed.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a funny kind of song, set to the
old tune of the Lord-Lieutenant or Deputy, and with it I will
conclude my discourse, for I really think it&rsquo;s past
one.&rdquo;&nbsp; The jockey then, with a very tolerable voice,
sung the following song:&mdash;</p>
<h3>THE JOCKEY&rsquo;S SONG.</h3>
<blockquote><p>Now list to a ditty both funny and true!&mdash;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Merrily moves the dance along&mdash;<br />
A ditty that tells of a coward and screw,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.</p>
<p>Sir Plume, though not liking a bullet at all,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Merrily moves the dance along&mdash;<br />
Had yet resolution to go to a <i>ball</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woulez wous danser, mademoiselle?&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Merrily moves the dance along;&mdash;<br />
Said she, &ldquo;Sir, to dance I should like very well,&rdquo;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.</p>
<p>They danc&rsquo;d to the left, and they danc&rsquo;d to the
right,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Merrily moves the dance along;&mdash;<br />
And her troth the fair damsel bestow&rsquo;d on the knight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, what shall I fetch you,
mademoiselle?&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Merrily moves the dance along;&mdash;<br />
Said she, &ldquo;Sir, an ice I should like very well,&rdquo;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.</p>
<p>But the ice, when he&rsquo;d got it, he instantly
ate,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Merrily moves the dance along;&mdash;<br />
Although his poor partner was all in a fret,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.</p>
<p>He ate up the ice like a prudent young lord,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Merrily moves the dance along;&mdash;<br />
For he saw &rsquo;t was the very last ice on the board,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, when shall we marry?&rdquo; the gentleman
cried;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Merrily moves the dance along;&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Sir, get you to Jordan,&rdquo; the damsel replied,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never will wed with the pitiful elf&rdquo;&mdash;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Merrily moves the dance along&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Who ate up the ice which I wanted myself,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d pardon your backing from red
Waterloo,&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Merrily moves the dance along&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;But I never will wed with a coward and screw,&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Lord-Lieutenant so free and young.</p>

273</span>CHAPTER XLIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning I began to think
of departing; I had sewed up the money which I had received for
the horse in a portion of my clothing, where I entertained no
fears for its safety, with the exception of a small sum in notes,
gold and silver, which I carried in my pocket.&nbsp; Ere
departing, however, I determined to stroll about and examine the
town, and observe more particularly the humours of the fair than
I had hitherto an opportunity of doing.&nbsp; The town, when I
examined it, offered no object worthy of attention but its
church&mdash;an edifice of some antiquity; under the guidance of
an old man, who officiated as sexton, I inspected its interior
attentively, occasionally conversing with my guide, who, however,
seemed much more disposed to talk about horses than the
church.&nbsp; &ldquo;No good horses in the fair this time,
measter,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;none but one brought hither by a
chap whom nobody knows, and bought by a foreigneering man, who
came here with Jack Dale.&nbsp; The horse fetched a good swinging
price, which is said, however, to be much less than its worth;
for the horse is a regular clipper; not such a one &rsquo;tis
said, has been seen in the fair for several summers.&nbsp; Lord
Whitefeather says that he believes the fellow who brought him to
be a highwayman, and talks of having him taken up, but Lord
Whitefeather is only in a rage because he could not get him for
himself.&nbsp; The chap would not sell it to un; Lord Screw
wanted to beat him down, and the chap took huff, said he
wouldn&rsquo;t sell it to him at no price, and accepted the offer
of the foreigneering man, or of Jack, who was his
&rsquo;terpreter, and who scorned to higgle about such an
hanimal, because Jack is a gentleman, though bred a dickey-boy,
whilst &rsquo;tother, though bred a Lord, is a screw and a
whitefeather.&nbsp; Every one says the cove was right, and I says
so too; I likes spirit, and if the cove were here, and in your
place, measter, I would invite him to drink a pint of beer.&nbsp;
Good horses are scarce now, measter, ay, and so are good men,
quite a different set from what there were when I was young; that
was the time for men and horses.&nbsp; Lord bless you, I know all
the breeders about here; they are not a bad set, and they breed a
very fairish set of horses, <a name="page274"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 274</span>but they are not like what their
fathers were, nor are their horses like their fathers&rsquo;
horses.&nbsp; Now there is Mr. &mdash;, the great breeder, a very
fairish man, with very fairish horses; but, Lord bless you,
he&rsquo;s nothing to what his father was, nor his steeds to his
father&rsquo;s; I ought to know, for I was at the school here
with his father, and afterwards for many a year helped him to get
up his horses; that was when I was young, measter&mdash;those
were the days.&nbsp; You look at that monument, measter,&rdquo;
said he, as I stopped and looked attentively at a monument on the
southern side of the church near the altar; &ldquo;that was put
up for a rector of this church, who lived a long time ago, in
Oliver&rsquo;s time, and was ill-treated and imprisoned by Oliver
and his men; you will see all about it on the monument.&nbsp;
There was a grand battle fought nigh this place, between
Oliver&rsquo;s men and the Royal party, and the Royal party had
the worst of it, as I&rsquo;m told they generally had; and
Oliver&rsquo;s men came into the town, and did a great deal of
damage, and ill-treated the people.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t remember
anything about the matter myself, for it happened just one
hundred years before I was born, but my father was acquainted
with an old countryman, who lived not many miles from here, who
said he remembered perfectly well the day of the battle; that he
was a boy at the time, and was working in a field near the place
where the battle was fought, and he heard shouting and noise of
firearms, and also the sound of several balls, which fell in the
field near him.&nbsp; Come this way, measter, and I will show you
some remains of that day&rsquo;s field.&rdquo;&nbsp; Leaving the
monument, on which was inscribed an account of the life and
sufferings of the Royalist Rector of Horncastle, I followed the
sexton to the western end of the church, where, hanging against
the wall, were a number of scythes stuck in the ends of
poles.&nbsp; &ldquo;Those are the weapons, measter,&rdquo; said
the sexton, &ldquo;which the great people put into the hands of a
number of the country folks, in order that they might use them
against Oliver&rsquo;s men; ugly weapons enough; however,
Oliver&rsquo;s men won, and Sir Jacob Ashley and his party were
beat.&nbsp; And a rare time Oliver and his men had of it, till
Oliver died, when the other party got the better, not by
fighting, &rsquo;tis said, but through a General Monk, who turned
sides.&nbsp; Ah, the old fellow that my father knew said he well
remembered the time when General Monk went over and proclaimed
Charles the Second.&nbsp; Bonfires were lighted everywhere, oxen
roasted, and beer drunk by pailfuls; the country folks were drunk
with joy, and something else; sung scurvy songs about Oliver to
the tune of Barney Banks, and pelted his men, wherever they found
them, with stones and dirt.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The more <a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>ungrateful
scoundrels they,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oliver and his men
fought the battle of English independence against a wretched king
and corrupt lords.&nbsp; Had I been living at the time, I should
have been proud to be a trooper of Oliver.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You would, measter, would you?&nbsp; Well, I never
quarrels with the opinions of people who come to look at the
church, and certainly independence is a fine thing.&nbsp; I like
to see a chap of an independent spirit, and if I were now to see
the cove who refused to sell his horse to my Lord Screw and
Whitefeather, and let Jack Dale have him, I would offer to treat
him to a pint of beer&mdash;e&rsquo;es, I would, verily.&nbsp;
Well, measter, you have now seen the church, and all
there&rsquo;s in it worth seeing&mdash;so I&rsquo;ll just lock
up, and go and finish digging the grave I was about when you
came, after which I must go into the fair to see how matters are
going on.&nbsp; Thank ye, measter,&rdquo; said he, as I put
something into his hand; &ldquo;thank ye kindly; &rsquo;tis not
every one who gives me a shilling now-a-days who comes to see the
church, but times are very different from what they were when I
was young; I was not sexton then, but something better; helped
Mr. &mdash; with his horses, and got many a broad crown.&nbsp;
Those were the days, measter, both for men and horses; and I say,
measter, if men and horses were so much better when I was young
than they are now, what, I wonder, must they have been in the
time of Oliver and his men?&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>CHAPTER XLIV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Leaving</span> the church, I strolled
through the fair, looking at the horses, listening to the
chaffering of the buyers and sellers, and occasionally putting in
a word of my own, which was not always received with much
deference; suddenly, however, on a whisper arising that I was the
young cove who had brought the wonderful horse to the fair which
Jack Dale had bought for the foreigneering man, I found myself an
object of the greatest attention; those who had before replied
with stuff! and nonsense! to what I said, now listened with the
greatest eagerness to any nonsense which I chose to utter, and I
did not fail to utter a great deal; presently, however, becoming
disgusted with the beings about me, I forced my way, not very
civilly, through my crowd of admirers; and passing through an
alley and a back street, at last reached an outskirt of the fair,
where no person appeared to know me.&nbsp; Here I stood, looking
vacantly on what was going on, musing on the strange infatuation
of my species, who judge of a person&rsquo;s words, not from
their intrinsic merit, but from the opinion&mdash;generally an
erroneous one&mdash;which they have formed of the person.&nbsp;
From this reverie I was roused by certain words which sounded
near me, uttered in a strange tone, and in a strange
cadence&mdash;the words were, &ldquo;them that finds, wins; and
them that can&rsquo;t find, loses&rdquo;.&nbsp; Turning my eyes
in the direction from which the words proceeded, I saw six or
seven people, apparently all countrymen, gathered round a person
standing behind a tall white table of very small compass.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the thimble-engro of &mdash;
Fair here at Horncastle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Advancing nearer, however,
I perceived that though the present person was a thimble-engro,
he was a very different one from my old acquaintance of &mdash;
Fair.&nbsp; The present one was a fellow about half a foot taller
than the other.&nbsp; He had a long, haggard, wild face, and was
dressed in a kind of jacket, something like that of a soldier,
with dirty hempen trousers, and with a foreign-looking peaked hat
on his head.&nbsp; He spoke with an accent evidently Irish, and
occasionally changed the usual thimble formule into, &ldquo;them
that finds, wins, and them that can&rsquo;t&mdash;och,
sure!&mdash;they loses&rdquo;; saying also frequently,
&ldquo;your honour,&rdquo; <a name="page277"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 277</span>instead of &ldquo;my
lord&rdquo;.&nbsp; I observed, on drawing nearer, that he handled
the pea and thimble with some awkwardness, like that which might
be expected from a novice in the trade.&nbsp; He contrived,
however, to win several shillings, for he did not seem to play
for gold, from &ldquo;their honours&rdquo;.&nbsp; Awkward as he
was, he evidently did his best, and never flung a chance away by
permitting any one to win.&nbsp; He had just won three shillings
from a farmer, who, incensed at his loss, was calling him a
confounded cheat, and saying that he would play no more, when up
came my friend of the preceding day, Jack, the jockey.&nbsp; This
worthy, after looking at the thimble-man a moment or two, with a
peculiarly crafty glance, cried out, as he clapped down a
shilling on the table, &ldquo;I will stand you, old
fellow!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Them that finds, wins; and them that
can&rsquo;t&mdash;och, sure!&mdash;they loses,&rdquo; said the
thimble-man.&nbsp; The game commenced, and Jack took up the
thimble without finding the pea; another shilling was produced,
and lost in the same manner: &ldquo;this is slow work,&rdquo;
said Jack, banging down a guinea on the table; &ldquo;can you
cover that, old fellow?&rdquo;&nbsp; The man of the thimble
looked at the gold, and then at him who produced it, and
scratched his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, cover that, or I shall be
off,&rdquo; said the jockey.&nbsp; &ldquo;Och, sure, my
lord!&mdash;no, I mean your honour&mdash;no, sure, your
lordship,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;if I covers it at all, it
must be with silver, for divil a bit of gold have I by
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, then, produce the value in
silver,&rdquo; said the jockey, &ldquo;and do it quickly, for I
can&rsquo;t be staying here all day.&rdquo;&nbsp; The thimble-man
hesitated, looked at Jack with a dubious look, then at the gold,
and then scratched his head.&nbsp; There was now a laugh amongst
the surrounders, which evidently nettled the fellow, who
forthwith thrust his hand into his pocket, and pulling out all
his silver treasure, just contrived to place the value of the
guinea on the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;Them that finds, wins, and them
that can&rsquo;t find&mdash;<i>loses</i>,&rdquo; interrupted
Jack, lifting up a thimble, out of which rolled a pea.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There, paddy, what do you think of that?&rdquo; said he,
seizing the heap of silver with one hand, whilst he pocketed the
guinea with the other.&nbsp; The thimble-engro stood, for some
time, like one transfixed, his eyes glaring wildly, now at the
table, and now at his successful customer; at last he said:
&ldquo;Arrah, sure, master!&mdash;no, I manes my lord&mdash;you
are not going to ruin a poor boy!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ruin
you!&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;what! by winning a
guinea&rsquo;s change? a pretty small dodger you&mdash;if you
have not sufficient capital, why do you engage in so deep a trade
as thimbling? come, will you stand another game?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Och, sure, master, no! the twenty shillings and one which
you have chated me of were all <a name="page278"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 278</span>I had in the world.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Cheated you,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;say that again, and
I will knock you down.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Arrah! sure, master,
you knows that the pea under the thimble was not mine; here is
mine master; now give me back my money.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;A
likely thing,&rdquo; said Jack; &ldquo;no, no, I know a trick
worth two or three of that; whether the pea was yours or mine,
you will never have your twenty shillings and one again; and if I
have ruined you, all the better; I&rsquo;d gladly ruin all such
villains as you, who ruin poor men with your dirty tricks, whom
you would knock down and rob on the road, if you had but courage:
not that I mean to keep your shillings, with the exception of the
two you cheated from me, which I&rsquo;ll keep.&nbsp; A scramble,
boys! a scramble!&rdquo; said he, flinging up all the silver into
the air, with the exception of the two shillings; and a scramble
there instantly was, between the rustics who had lost their money
and the urchins who came running up; the poor thimble-engro tried
likewise to have his share; but though he flung himself down, in
order to join more effectually in the scramble, he was unable to
obtain a single sixpence; and having in his rage given some of
his fellow-scramblers a cuff or two, he was set upon by the boys
and country fellows, and compelled to make an inglorious retreat
with his table, which had been flung down in the scuffle, and had
one of its legs broken.&nbsp; As he retired, the rabble hooted,
and Jack, holding up in derision the pea with which he had
out-man&oelig;uvred him, exclaimed: &ldquo;I always carry this in
my pocket in order to be a match for vagabonds like
you&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The tumult over, Jack gone, and the rabble dispersed, I
followed the discomfited adventurer at a distance, who, leaving
the town, went slowly on, carrying his dilapidated piece of
furniture, till coming to an old wall by the roadside, he placed
it on the ground, and sat down, seemingly in deep despondency,
holding his thumb to his mouth.&nbsp; Going nearly up to him, I
stood still, whereupon he looked up, and perceiving I was looking
steadfastly at him, he said, in a angry tone: &ldquo;Arrah! what
for are you staring at me so?&nbsp; By my shoul, I think you are
one of the thaives who are after robbing me.&nbsp; I think I saw
you among them, and if I were only sure of it, I would take the
liberty of trying to give you a big bating.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have had enough of trying to give people a
beating,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you had better be taking your
table to some skilful carpenter to get it repaired.&nbsp; He will
do it for sixpence.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Divil a sixpence did you
and your thaives leave me,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and if you do
not take yourself off, joy, I will be breaking your ugly head
with the foot of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Arrah, Murtagh!&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;would ye be breaking the head of your friend and
scholar <a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>to whom you taught the blessed tongue of Oilien nan
Naomha, in exchange for a pack of cards?&rdquo;&nbsp; Murtagh,
for he it was, gazed at me for a moment with a bewildered look;
then, with a gleam of intelligence in his eye, he said:
&ldquo;Shorsha! no, it can&rsquo;t be&mdash;yes by my faith it
is!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, springing up and seizing me by the hand,
he said: &ldquo;Yes, by the powers, sure enough it is Shorsha
agra! Arrah, Shorsha! where have you been this many a day?&nbsp;
Sure, you are not one of the spalpeens who are after robbing
me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but I saw
all that happened.&nbsp; Come, you must not take matters so to
heart; cheer up; such things will happen in connection with the
trade you have taken up.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sorrow befall the
trade, and the thief who taught it me,&rdquo; said Murtagh;
&ldquo;and yet the trade is not a bad one, if I only knew more of
it, and had some one to help and back me.&nbsp; Och! the idea of
being cheated and bamboozled by that one-eyed thief in the
horseman&rsquo;s dress.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Let bygones be
bygones, Murtagh,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;it is no use grieving for
the past; sit down, and let us have a little pleasant
gossip.&nbsp; Arrah, Murtagh! when I saw you sitting under the
wall, with your thumb to your mouth, it brought to my mind tales
which you used to tell me all about Finn-ma-Coul.&nbsp; You have
not forgotten Finn-ma-Coul, Murtagh, and how he sucked wisdom out
of his thumb.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sorrow a bit have I forgot
about him, Shorsha,&rdquo; said Murtagh, as we sat down together,
&ldquo;nor what you yourself told me about the snake.&nbsp;
Arrah, Shorsha! what ye told me about the snake bates anything I
ever told you about Finn.&nbsp; Ochone, Shorsha! perhaps you will
be telling me about the snake once more?&nbsp; I think the tale
would do me good, and I have need of comfort, God knows,
ochone!&rdquo;&nbsp; Seeing Murtagh in such a distressed plight,
I forthwith told him over again the tale of the snake, in
precisely the same words as I have related it in the first part
of this history.&nbsp; After which, I said: &ldquo;Now, Murtagh,
tit for tat; ye will be telling me one of the old stories of
Finn-ma-Coul&rdquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;Och, Shorsha! I haven&rsquo;t
heart enough,&rdquo; said Murtagh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you for
your tale, but it makes me weep; it brings to my mind Dungarvon
times of old&mdash;I mean the times we were at school
together.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Cheer up, man,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;and let&rsquo;s have the story, and let it be about
Ma-Coul and the salmon and his thumb.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Arrah,
Shorsha! I can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Well, to oblige you, I&rsquo;ll
give it you.&nbsp; Well, you know Ma-Coul was an exposed child,
and came floating over the salt sea in a chest which was cast
ashore at Veintry Bay.&nbsp; In the corner of that bay was a
castle, where dwelt a giant and his wife, very respectable and
dacent people, and this giant, taking his morning walk along the
bay, came to the place where <a name="page280"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>the child had been cast ashore in
his box.&nbsp; Well, the giant looked at the child, and being
filled with compassion for his exposed state, took the child up
in his box, and carried him home to his castle, where he and his
wife, being dacent respectable people, as I telled ye before,
fostered the child and took care of him, till he became old
enough to go out to service and gain his livelihood, when they
bound him out apprentice to another giant, who lived in a castle
up the country, at some distance from the bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This giant, whose name was Darmod David Odeen, was not
a respectable person at all, but a big ould wagabone.&nbsp; He
was twice the size of the other giant, who, though bigger than
any man, was not a big giant; for, as there are great and small
men, so there are great and small giants&mdash;I mean some are
small when compared with the others.&nbsp; Well, Finn served this
giant a considerable time, doing all kinds of hard and
unreasonable service for him, and receiving all kinds of hard
words, and many a hard knock and kick to boot&mdash;sorrow befall
the ould wagabone who could thus ill-treat a helpless
foundling.&nbsp; It chanced that one day the giant caught a
salmon, near a salmon-leap upon his estate&mdash;for, though a
big ould blackguard, he was a person of considerable landed
property, and high sheriff for the county Cork.&nbsp; Well, the
giant brings home the salmon by the gills, and delivers it to
Finn, telling him to roast it for the giant&rsquo;s dinner;
&lsquo;but take care, ye young blackguard,&rsquo; he added,
&lsquo;that in roasting it&mdash;and I expect ye to roast it
well&mdash;you do not let a blister come upon its nice satin
skin, for if ye do, I will cut the head off your
shoulders&rsquo;.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; thinks Finn,
&lsquo;this is a hard task; however, as I have done many hard
tasks for him, I will try and do this too, though I was never set
to do anything yet half so difficult.&rsquo;&nbsp; So he prepared
his fire, and put his gridiron upon it, and lays the salmon
fairly and softly upon the gridiron, and then he roasts it,
turning it from one side to the other just in the nick of time,
before the soft satin skin could be blistered.&nbsp; However, on
turning it over the eleventh time&mdash;and twelve would have
settled the business&mdash;he found he had delayed a little bit
of time too long in turning it over, and that there was a small,
tiny blister on the soft outer skin.&nbsp; Well, Finn was in a
mighty panic, remembering the threats of the ould giant; however,
he did not lose heart, but clapped his thumb upon the blister in
order to smooth it down.&nbsp; Now the salmon, Shorsha, was
nearly done, and the flesh thoroughly hot, so Finn&rsquo;s thumb
was scalt, and he, clapping it to his mouth, sucked it, in order
to draw out the pain, and in a
moment&mdash;hubbuboo!&mdash;became imbued with all the wisdom of
the world.&rdquo;</p>

281</span><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Stop, Murtagh! stop!</p>
<p><i>Murtagh</i>.&nbsp; All the witchcraft, Shorsha.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; How wonderful!</p>
<p><i>Murtagh</i>.&nbsp; Was it not, Shorsha?&nbsp; The salmon,
do you see, was a fairy salmon.</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; What a strange coincidence!</p>
<p><i>Murtagh</i>.&nbsp; A what, Shorsha?</p>
<p><i>Myself</i>.&nbsp; Why, that the very same tale should be
told of Finn-ma-Coul which is related of Sigurd Fafnisbane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What thief was that, Shorsha?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thief!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true, he took the treasure of
Fafnir.&nbsp; Sigurd was the hero of the North, Murtagh, even as
Finn is the great hero of Ireland.&nbsp; He, too, according to
one account, was an exposed child, and came floating in a casket
to a wild shore, where he was suckled by a hind, and afterwards
found and fostered by Mimir, a fairy blacksmith; he, too, sucked
wisdom from a burn.&nbsp; According to the Edda, he burnt his
finger whilst feeling of the heart of Fafnir, which he was
roasting, and putting it into his mouth in order to suck out the
pain, became imbued with all the wisdom of the world, the
knowledge of the language of birds, and what not.&nbsp; I have
heard you tell the tale of Finn a dozen times in the blessed days
of old, but its identity with the tale of Sigurd never occurred
to me till now.&nbsp; It is true, when I knew you of old, I had
never read the tale of Sigurd, and have since almost dismissed
matters of Ireland from my mind; but as soon as you told me again
about Finn&rsquo;s burning his finger, the coincidence struck
me.&nbsp; I say, Murtagh, the Irish owe much to the
Danes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devil a bit, Shorsha, do they owe to the thaives,
except many a bloody bating and plundering, which they never paid
them back.&nbsp; Och, Shorsha! you, edicated in ould Ireland, to
say that the Irish owes anything good to the plundering
villains&mdash;the <i>Siol Loughlin</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They owe them half their traditions, Murtagh, and
amongst others, Finn-ma-Coul and the burnt finger; and if ever I
publish the Loughlin songs, I&rsquo;ll tell the world
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Shorsha, the world will never believe ye&mdash;to
say nothing of the Irish part of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the world, Murtagh&mdash;to say nothing of the
Irish part of it&mdash;will be a fool, even as I have often
thought it; the grand thing, Murtagh, is to be able to believe
oneself, and respect oneself.&nbsp; How few whom the world
believes believe and respect themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Och, Shorsha! shall I go on with the tale of
Finn?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather you should not, Murtagh, I know
all about it already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did you bother me to tell it at first,
Shorsha?&nbsp; Och, it was doing my ownself good, and making me
forget my own sorrowful state, when ye interrupted me with your
thaives of Danes!&nbsp; Och, Shorsha! let me tell you how Finn,
by means of sucking his thumb, and the witchcraft he imbibed from
it, contrived to pull off the arm of the ould wagabone, Darmod
David Odeen, whilst shaking hands with him&mdash;for Finn could
do no feat of strength without sucking his thumb, Shorsha, as
Conan the Bald told the son of Oisin in the song which I used to
sing ye in Dungarvon times of old;&rdquo; and here Murtagh
repeated certain Irish words to the following effect:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>O little the foolish words I heed<br />
O Oisin&rsquo;s son, from thy lips which come;<br />
No strength were in Finn for valorous deed,<br />
Unless to the gristle he suck&rsquo;d his thumb.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Enough is as good as a feast, Murtagh, I am no longer
in the cue for Finn.&nbsp; I would rather hear your own
history.&nbsp; Now tell us, man, all that has happened to ye
since Dungarvon times of old?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Och, Shorsha, it would be merely bringing all my
sorrows back upon me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I know all your sorrows, perhaps I shall be
able to find a help for them.&nbsp; I owe you much, Murtagh; you
taught me Irish, and I will do all I can to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then, Shorsha, I&rsquo;ll tell ye my
history.&nbsp; Here goes!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>CHAPTER XLV.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Well</span>, Shorsha, about a year
and a half after you left us&mdash;and a sorrowful hour for us it
was when ye left us, losing, as we did, your funny stories of
your snake, and the battles of your military&mdash;they sent me
to Paris and Salamanca, in order to make a <i>saggart</i> of
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray excuse me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for interrupting
you, but what kind of place is Salamanca?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Divil a bit did I ever see of it, Shorsha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why did you say ye were sent there?&nbsp; Well,
what kind of place is Paris?&nbsp; Not that I care much about
Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorrow a bit did I ever see of either of them, Shorsha,
for no one sent me to either.&nbsp; When we says at home a person
is going to Paris and Salamanca, it manes that he is going abroad
to study to be a <i>saggart</i>, whether he goes to them places
or not.&nbsp; No, I never saw either&mdash;bad luck to
them&mdash;I was shipped away from Cork up the straits to a place
called Leghorn, from which I was sent to &mdash; to a religious
house, where I was to be instructed in saggarting till they had
made me fit to cut a dacent figure in Ireland.&nbsp; We had a
long and tedious voyage, Shorsha; not so tedious, however, as it
would have been had I been fool enough to lave your pack of cards
behind me, as the thaif, my brother Denis, wanted to persuade me
to do, in order that he might play with them himself.&nbsp; With
the cards I managed to have many a nice game with the sailors,
winning from them ha&rsquo;pennies and sixpences until the
captain said that I was ruining his men, and keeping them from
their duty; and being a heretic and a Dutchman, swore that unless
I gave over he would tie me up to the mast and give me a round
dozen.&nbsp; This threat obliged me to be more on my guard,
though I occasionally contrived to get a game at night, and to
win sixpennies and ha&rsquo;pennies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We reached Leghorn at last, and glad I was to leave the
ship and the master, who gave me a kick as I was getting over the
side, bad luck to the dirty heretic for kicking a son of the
Church, for I have always been a true son of the Church, Shorsha,
and never quarrelled with it unless it interfered with me in my
playing at <a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
284</span>cards.&nbsp; I left Leghorn with certain muleteers,
with whom I played at cards at the baiting-houses, and who
speedily won from me all the ha&rsquo;pennies and sixpences I had
won from the sailors.&nbsp; I got my money&rsquo;s worth,
however, for I learnt from the muleteers all kind of quaint
tricks upon the cards, which I knew nothing of before; so I did
not grudge them what they chated me of, and when we parted we did
so in kindness on both sides.&nbsp; On getting to &mdash; I was
received into the religious house for Irishes.&nbsp; It was the
Irish house, Shorsha, into which I was taken, for I do not wish
ye to suppose that I was in the English religious house which
there is in that city, in which a purty set are edicated, and in
which purty doings are going on if all tales be true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this Irish house I commenced my studies, learning to
sing and to read the Latin prayers of the Church.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Faith, Shorsha, many&rsquo;s the sorrowful day I passed in
that house learning the prayers and litanies, being half-starved,
with no earthly diversion at all, at all, until I took the cards
out of my chest and began instructing in card-playing the chum
which I had with me in the cell; then I had plenty of diversion
along with him during the times when I was not engaged in
singing, and chanting, and saying the prayers of the Church;
there was, however, some drawback in playing with my chum, for
though he was very clever in learning, divil a sixpence had he to
play with, in which respect he was like myself, the master who
taught him, who had lost all my money to the muleteers who taught
me the tricks upon the cards; by degrees, however, it began to be
noised about the religious house that Murtagh from Hibrodary, <a
name="citation284"></a><a href="#footnote284"
class="citation">[284]</a> had a pack of cards with which he
played with his chum in the cell; whereupon other scholars of the
religious house came to me, some to be taught and others to play,
so with some I played, and others I taught, but neither to those
who could play, or to those who could not, did I teach the
elegant tricks which I learnt from the muleteers.&nbsp; Well, the
scholars came to me for the sake of the cards, and the porter and
the cook of the religious house, who could both play very well,
came also; at last I became tired of playing for nothing, so I
borrowed a few bits of silver from the cook, and played against
the porter, and by means of my tricks I won money from the porter
and then I paid the cook the bits of silver which I had borrowed
of him, and played with him, and won a little of his money, which
I let him win back again, as I had lived long enough in a
religious house to know that it is dangerous to take <a
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>money from
the cook.&nbsp; In a little time, Shorsha, there was scarcely
anything going on in the house but card-playing; the almoner
played with me, and so did the sub-rector, and I won money from
both; not too much, however, lest they should tell the rector,
who had the character of a very austere man and of being a bit of
a saint; however, the thief of a porter, whose money I had won,
informed the rector of what was going on, and one day the rector
sent for me into his private apartment, and gave me so long and
pious a lecture upon the heinous sin of card-playing, that I
thought I should sink into the ground; after about half an
hour&rsquo;s inveighing against card-playing, he began to soften
his tone, and with a long sigh told me that at one time of his
life he had been a young man himself, and had occasionally used
the cards; he then began to ask me some questions about
card-playing, which questions I afterwards found were to pump
from me what I knew about the science.&nbsp; After a time he
asked me whether I had got my cards with me, and on my telling
him I had, he expressed a wish to see them, whereupon I took the
pack out of my pocket, and showed it to him; he looked at it very
attentively, and at last, giving another deep sigh, he said: that
though he was nearly weaned from the vanities of the world, he
had still an inclination to see whether he had entirely lost the
little skill which at one time he possessed.&nbsp; When I heard
him speak in this manner, I told him that if his reverence was
inclined for a game of cards, I should be very happy to play one
with him; scarcely had I uttered these words than he gave a third
sigh, and looked so very much like a saint that I was afraid he
was going to excommunicate me.&nbsp; Nothing of the kind,
however, for presently he gets up and locks the door, then
sitting down at the table, he motioned me to do the same, which I
did, and in five minutes there we were playing at cards, his
reverence and myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I soon found that his reverence knew quite as much
about card-playing as I did.&nbsp; Divil a trick was there
connected with cards that his reverence did not seem awake
to.&nbsp; As, however, we were not playing for money, this
circumstance did not give me much uneasiness; so we played game
after game for two hours, when his reverence, having business,
told me I might go, so I took up my cards, made my obedience, and
left him.&nbsp; The next day I had other games with him, and so
on for a very long time, still playing for nothing.&nbsp; At last
his reverence grew tired of playing for nothing, and proposed
that we should play for money.&nbsp; Now, I had no desire to play
with his reverence for <a name="page286"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 286</span>money, as I knew that doing so would
bring on a quarrel.&nbsp; As long as we were playing for nothing,
I could afford to let his reverence use what tricks he pleased;
but if we played for money, I couldn&rsquo;t do so.&nbsp; If he
played his tricks, I must play mine, and use every advantage to
save my money; and there was one I possessed which his reverence
did not.&nbsp; The cards being my own, I had put some delicate
little marks on the trump cards, just at the edges, so that when
I daylt, by means of a little sleight of hand, I could dale
myself any trump card I pleased.&nbsp; But I wished, as I said
before, to have no dealings for money with his reverence, knowing
that he was master in the house, and that he could lead me a dog
of a life, if I offended him, either by winning his money, or not
letting him win mine.&nbsp; So I told him I had no money to play
with, but the ould thief knew better; he knew that I was every
day winning money from the scholars, and the sub-rector, and the
other people of the house, and the ould thaif had determined to
let me go on in that way winning money, and then by means of his
tricks, which he thought I dare not resent, to win from me all my
earnings&mdash;in a word, Shorsha, to let me fill myself like a
sponge, and then squeeze me for his own advantage.&nbsp; So he
made me play with him, and in less than three days came on the
quarrel; his reverence chated me, and I chated his reverence; the
ould thaif knew every trick that I knew, and one or two more; but
in daling out the cards I nicked his reverence; scarcely a trump
did I ever give him, Shorsha, and won his money purty
freely.&nbsp; Och, it was a purty quarrel!&nbsp; All the delicate
names in the <i>Newgate Calendar</i>, if ye ever heard of such a
book; all the hang-dog names in the Newgate histories, and the
lives of Irish rogues, did we call each other&mdash;his reverence
and I!&nbsp; Suddenly, however, putting out his hand, he seized
the cards, saying, &lsquo;I will examine these cards, ye chating
scoundrel! for I believe there are dirty marks on them, which ye
have made in order to know the winning cards.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Give me back my pack,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;or
<i>m&rsquo;anam on Dioul</i> if I be not the death of
ye!&rsquo;&nbsp; His reverence, however, clapped the cards into
his pocket, and made the best of his way to the door, I hanging
upon him.&nbsp; He was a gross, fat man, but, like most fat men,
deadly strong, so he forced his way to the door, and, opening it,
flung himself out, with me still holding on him like a terrier
dog on a big fat pig; then he shouts for help, and in a little
time I was secured and thrust into a lock-up room, where I was
left to myself.&nbsp; Here was a purty alteration.&nbsp;
Yesterday I was the idol of the religious house, thought more on
than his reverence, every one paying me court <a
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>and
wurtship, and wanting to play cards with me, and to learn my
tricks, and fed, moreover, on the tidbits of the table; and
to-day I was in a cell, nobody coming to look at me but the
blackguard porter who had charge of me, my cards taken from me,
and with nothing but bread and water to live upon.&nbsp; Time
passed dreary enough for a month, at the end of which time his
reverence came to me, leaving the porter just outside the door in
order to come to his help should I be violent; and then he read
me a very purty lecture on my conduct, saying I had turned the
religious house topsy-turvy, and corrupted the scholars, and that
I was the chate of the world, for that on inspecting the pack he
had discovered the dirty marks which I had made upon the trump
cards for to know them by.&nbsp; He said a good dale more to me,
which is not worth relating, and ended by telling me that he
intended to let me out of confinement next day, but that if ever
I misconducted myself any more, he would clap me in again for the
rest of my life.&nbsp; I had a good mind to call him an ould
thaif, but the hope of getting out made me hold my tongue, and
the next day I was let out; and need enough I had to be let out,
for what with being alone, and living on the bread and water, I
was becoming frighted, or, as the doctors call it, narvous.&nbsp;
But when I was out&mdash;oh, what a change I found in the
religious house; no card-playing, for it had been forbidden to
the scholars, and there was now nothing going on but reading and
singing; divil a merry visage to be seen, but plenty of prim airs
and graces; but the case of the scholars, though bad enough, was
not half so bad as mine, for they could speak to each other,
whereas I could not have a word of conversation, for the ould
thaif of a rector had ordered them to send me to
&lsquo;Coventry,&rsquo; telling them that I was a gambling chate,
with morals bad enough to corrupt a horse regiment; and whereas
they were allowed to divert themselves with going out, I was kept
reading and singing from morn till night.&nbsp; The only soul who
was willing to exchange a word with me was the cook, and
sometimes he and I had a little bit of discourse in a corner, and
we condoled with each other, for he liked the change in the
religious house almost as little as myself; but he told me that,
for all the change below stairs, there was still card-playing
going on above, for that the ould thaif of a rector, and the
sub-rector, and the almoner played at cards together, and that
the rector won money from the others&mdash;the almoner had told
him so&mdash;and, moreover, that the rector was the thaif of the
world, had been a gambler in his youth, and had once been kicked
out of a club-house at Dublin for chating at cards, and after
that circumstance had apparently reformed and <a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>lived
dacently till the time when I came to the religious house with my
pack, but that the sight of that had brought him back to his ould
gambling.&nbsp; He told the cook, moreover, that the rector
frequently went out at night to the houses of the great clergy
and chated at cards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this melancholy state, with respect to myself,
things continued a long time, when suddenly there was a report
that his Holiness the Pope intended to pay a visit to the
religious house in order to examine into its state of
discipline.&nbsp; When I heard this I was glad, for I determined,
after the Pope had done what he had come to do, to fall upon my
knees before him, and make a regular complaint of the treatment I
had received, to tell him of the chating at cards of the rector,
and to beg him to make the ould thaif give me back my pack
again.&nbsp; So the day of the visit came, and his Holiness made
his appearance with his attendants, and, having looked over the
religious house, he went into the rector&rsquo;s room with the
rector, the sub-rector, and the almoner.&nbsp; I intended to have
waited until his Holiness came out, but finding he stayed a long
time I thought I would e&rsquo;en go into him, so I went up to
the door without anybody observing me&mdash;his attendants being
walking about the corridor&mdash;and opening it I slipped in, and
there what do you think I saw?&nbsp; Why, his Holiness the Pope,
and his reverence the rector, and the sub-rector, and the almoner
seated at cards; and the ould thaif of a rector was dealing out
the cards which ye had given me, Shorsha, to his Holiness the
Pope, the sub-rector, the almoner, and himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this part of his history I interrupted Murtagh, saying that
I was afraid he was telling untruths, and that it was highly
improbable that the Pope would leave the Vatican to play cards
with Irish at their religious house, and that I was sure, if on
his, Murtagh&rsquo;s authority, I were to tell the world so, the
world would never believe it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the world, Shorsha, would be a fool, even as you
were just now saying you had frequently believed it to be; the
grand thing, Shorsha, is to be able to believe oneself; if ye can
do that, it matters very little whether the world believes ye or
no.&nbsp; But a purty thing for you and the world to stickle at
the Pope&rsquo;s playing at cards at a religious house of Irish;
och! if I were to tell you and the world what the Pope has been
sometimes at, at the religious house of English thaives, I would
excuse you and the world for turning up your eyes.&nbsp; However,
I wish to say nothing against the Pope.&nbsp; I am a son of the
Church, and if the Pope don&rsquo;t interfere with my cards divil
a bit will I have to say against him; but I saw <a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>the Pope
playing, or about to play, with the pack which had been taken
from me, and when I told the Pope, the Pope did not&mdash;ye had
better let me go on with my history, Shorsha; whether you or the
world belave it or not, I am sure it is quite as true as your
tale of the snake, or saying that Finn got his burnt finger from
the thaives of Loughlin; and whatever you may say, I am sure the
world will think so too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I apologised to Murtagh for interrupting him, and telling him
that his history, whether true or not, was infinitely diverting,
begged him to continue it.</p>
<h2><a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>CHAPTER XLVI.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I <span class="smcap">was</span> telling ye, Shorsha,
when ye interrupted me, that I found the Pope, the rector, the
sub-rector and the almoner seated at the table, the rector with
my pack of cards in his hands, about to dale out to the Pope and
the rest, not forgetting himself, for whom he intended all the
trump-cards, no doubt.&nbsp; No sooner did they perceive me than
they seemed taken all aback; but the rector, suddenly starting up
with the cards in his hand, asked me what I did there,
threatening to have me well disciplined if I did not go about my
business; &lsquo;I am come for my pack,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;ye
ould thaif, and to tell his Holiness how I have been treated by
ye&rsquo;; then going down on my knees before his Holiness, I
said, &lsquo;Arrah, now, your Holiness! will ye not see justice
done to a poor boy who has been sadly misused?&nbsp; The pack of
cards which that ould ruffian has in his hand are my cards, which
he has taken from me, in order to chate with.&nbsp; Arrah!
don&rsquo;t play with him, your Holiness, for he&rsquo;ll only
chate ye&mdash;there are dirty marks upon the cards which bear
the trumps, put there in order to know them by; and the ould
thaif in dealing out will give himself all the good cards, and
chate ye of the last farthing in your pocket; so let them be
taken from him, your Holiness and given back to me; and order him
to lave the room, and then, if your Holiness be for an honest
game, don&rsquo;t think I am the boy to baulk ye.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll take the ould ruffian&rsquo;s place, and play with ye
till evening, and all night besides, and divil an advantage will
I take of the dirty marks, though I know them all, having placed
them on the cards myself.&rsquo;&nbsp; I was going on in this way
when the ould thaif of a rector, flinging down the cards, made at
me as if to kick me out of the room, whereupon I started up and
said: &lsquo;If ye are for kicking, sure two can play at
that&rsquo;; and then I kicked at his reverence, and his
reverence at me, and there was a regular scrimmage between us,
which frightened the Pope, who, getting up, said some words which
I did not understand, but which the cook afterwards told me were,
&lsquo;English extravagance, and this is the second
edition&rsquo;; for it seems that, a little time before, his
Holiness had been frightened in St. Peter&rsquo;s Church by the
servant of an English family, which those thaives <a
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>of the
English religious house had been endeavouring to bring over to
the Catholic faith, and who didn&rsquo;t approve of their being
converted.&nbsp; Och! his Holiness did us all sore injustice to
call us English, and to confound our house with the other; for
however dirty our house might be, our house was a clane house
compared with the English house, and we honest people compared
with those English thaives.&nbsp; Well, his Holiness was
frighted, and the almoner ran out, and brought in his
Holiness&rsquo;s attendants, and they laid hold of me, but I
struggled hard, and said: &lsquo;I will not go without my pack;
arrah, your Holiness! make them give me back my pack, which
Shorsha gave me in Dungarvon times of old&rsquo;; but my
struggles were of no use.&nbsp; I was pulled away and put in the
ould dungeon, and his Holiness went away sore frighted, crossing
himself much, and never returned again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the ould dungeon I was fastened to the wall by a
chain, and there I was disciplined once every other day for the
first three weeks, and then I was left to myself, and my chain,
and hunger; and there I sat in the dungeon, sometimes screeching,
sometimes holloing, for I soon became frighted, having nothing in
the cell to divert me.&nbsp; At last the cook found his way to me
by stealth, and comforted me a little, bringing me tidbits out of
the kitchen; and he visited me again and again&mdash;not often,
however, for he dare only come when he could steal away the key
from the custody of the thaif of a porter.&nbsp; I was three
years in the dungeon, and should have gone mad but for the cook,
and his words of comfort, and his tidbits, and nice books which
he brought me out of the library, which were the <i>Calendars of
Newgate</i> and the <i>Lives of Irish Rogues and Raparees</i>,
the only English books in the library.&nbsp; However, at the end
of three years, the ould thaif of a rector, wishing to look at
them books, missed them from the library, and made a perquisition
about them, and the thaif of a porter said that he
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if I had them, saying that he had once
seen me reading; and then the rector came with others to my cell,
and took my books from me, from under my straw, and asked me how
I came by them; and on my refusal to tell, they disciplined me
again till the blood ran down my back; and making more
perquisition they at last accused the cook of having carried the
books to me, and the cook not denying, he was given warning to
leave next day, but he left that night, and took me away with
him, for he stole the key, and came to me and cut my chain
through, and then he and I escaped from the religious house
through a window&mdash;the cook with a bundle, containing what
things he had.&nbsp; No sooner had we got out than the honest
cook <a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>gave me a little bit of money and a loaf, and told me
to follow a way which he pointed out, which he said would lead to
the sea; and then, having embraced me after the Italian way, he
left me, and I never saw him again.&nbsp; So I followed the way
which the cook pointed out, and in two days reached a seaport
called Chiviter Vik, terribly foot foundered, and there I met a
sailor who spoke Irish, and who belonged to a vessel just ready
to sail for France; and the sailor took me on board his vessel,
and said I was his brother, and the captain gave me a passage to
a place in France called Marseilles; and when I got there, the
captain and sailor got a little money for me and a passport, and
I travelled across the country towards a place they directed me
to called Bayonne, from which they said I might, perhaps, get to
Ireland.&nbsp; Coming, however, to a place called Pau, all my
money being gone, I enlisted into a regiment called the Army of
the Faith, which was going into Spain, for the King of Spain had
been dethroned and imprisoned by his own subjects, as perhaps you
may have heard; and the King of France, who was his cousin, was
sending an army to help him, under the command of his own son,
whom the English called Prince Hilt, because when he was told
that he was appointed to the command, he clapped his hand on the
hilt of his sword.&nbsp; So I enlisted into the regiment of the
Faith, which was made up of Spaniards, many of them priests who
had run out of Spain, and broken Germans, and foot-foundered
Irish like myself.&nbsp; It was said to be a blackguard regiment,
that same regiment of the Faith; but, &rsquo;faith, I saw nothing
blackguardly going on in it, for you would hardly reckon
card-playing, and dominoes, and pitch and toss blackguardly, and
I saw nothing else going on in it.&nbsp; There was one thing in
it which I disliked&mdash;the priests drawing their Spanish
knives occasionally, when they lost their money.&nbsp; After we
had been some time at Pau, the Army of the Faith was sent across
the mountains into Spain, as the vanguard of the French; and no
sooner did the Spaniards see the Faith than they made a dash at
it, and the Faith ran away, myself along with it, and got behind
the French army, which told it to keep there, and the Faith did
so, and followed the French army, which soon scattered the
Spaniards, and in the end placed the king on his throne
again.&nbsp; When the war was over the Faith was disbanded; some
of the foreigners, however, amongst whom I was one, were put into
a Guard regiment, and there I continued for more than a year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day, being at a place called the Escurial, I took
stock, as the tradesmen say, and found I possessed the sum of
eighty dollars won by playing at cards, for though I could not
play so <a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>well with the foreign cards as with the pack ye gave
me, Shorsha, I had yet contrived to win money from the priests
and soldiers of the Faith.&nbsp; Finding myself possessed of such
a capital I determined to leave the service, and to make the best
of my way to Ireland; so I deserted, but coming in an evil hour
to a place they calls Torre Lodones, I found the priest playing
at cards with his parishioners.&nbsp; The sight of the cards made
me stop, and then, fool like, notwithstanding the treasure I had
about me, I must wish to play, so not being able to speak their
language, I made signs to them to let me play, and the priest and
his thaives consented willingly; so I sat down to cards with the
priest and two of his parishioners, and in a little time had won
plenty of their money, but I had better never have done any such
a thing, for suddenly the priest and all his parishioners set
upon me and bate me, and took from me all I had, and cast me out
of the village more dead than alive.&nbsp; Och! it&rsquo;s a bad
village that; and if I had known what it was I would have avoided
it, or run straight through it, though I saw all the card-playing
in the world going on in it.&nbsp; There is a proverb about it,
as I was afterwards told, old as the time of the Moors, which
holds good to the present day&mdash;it is, that in Torre Lodones
there are twenty-four housekeepers, and twenty-five thieves,
maning that all the people are thaives, and the clergyman to
boot, who is not reckoned a housekeeper; and troth I found the
clergyman the greatest thaif of the lot.&nbsp; After being cast
out of that village I travelled for nearly a month, subsisting by
begging tolerably well, for though most of the Spanish are
thaives, they are rather charitable; but though charitable
thaives they do not like their own being taken from them without
leave being asked, as I found to my cost; for on my entering a
garden near Seville, without leave, to take an orange, the
labourer came running up and struck me to the ground with a
hatchet, giving me a big wound in the arm.&nbsp; I fainted with
loss of blood, and on reviving I found myself in a hospital at
Seville, to which the labourer and the people of the village had
taken me.&nbsp; I should have died of starvation in that hospital
had not some English people heard of me and come to see me; they
tended me with food till I was cured, and then paid my passage on
board a ship to London, to which place the ship carried me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I was in London with five shillings in my
pocket&mdash;all I had in the world&mdash;and that did not last
for long; and when it was gone I begged in the streets, but I did
not get much by that, except a month&rsquo;s hard labour in the
correction-house; and <a name="page294"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 294</span>when I came out I knew not what to
do, but thought I would take a walk in the country, for it was
springtime, and the weather was fine, so I took a walk about
seven miles from London, and came to a place where a great fair
was being held; and there I begged, but got nothing but a
halfpenny, and was thinking of going farther when I saw a man
with a table, like that of mine, playing with thimbles, as you
saw me.&nbsp; I looked at the play, and saw him win money, and
run away, and hunted by constables more than once.&nbsp; I kept
following the man, and at last entered into conversation with
him; and learning from him that he was in want of a companion to
help him, I offered to help him if he would pay me; he looked at
me from top to toe, and did not wish at first to have anything to
do with me, as he said my appearance was against me.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Faith, Shorsha, he had better have looked at home, for his
appearance was not much in his favour: he looked very much like a
Jew, Shorsha.&nbsp; However, he at last agreed to take me to be
his companion or bonnet as he called it; and I was to keep a
look-out, and let him know when constables were coming, and to
spake a good word for him occasionally, whilst he was chating
folks with his thimbles and his pea.&nbsp; So I became his
bonnet, and assisted him in the fair, and in many other fairs
beside; but I did not like my occupation much, or rather my
master, who, though not a big man, was a big thaif, and an unkind
one, for do all I could I could never give him pleasure; and he
was continually calling me fool and bogtrotter, and twitting me
because I could not learn his thaives&rsquo; Latin, and discourse
with him in it, and comparing me with another acquaintance, or
bit of a pal of his, whom he said he had parted with in the fair,
and of whom he was fond of saying all kinds of wonderful things,
amongst others, that he knew the grammar of all tongues.&nbsp; At
last, wearied with being twitted by him with not being able to
learn his thaives&rsquo; Greek, I proposed that I should teach
him Irish, that we should spake it together when we had anything
to say in secret.&nbsp; To that he consented willingly; but, och!
a purty hand he made with Irish, &rsquo;faith, not much better
than did I with his thaives&rsquo; Hebrew.&nbsp; Then my turn
came, and I twitted him nicely with dulness, and compared him
with a pal that I had in ould Ireland, in Dungarvon times of
yore, to whom I teached Irish, telling him that he was the broth
of a boy, and not only knew the grammar of all human tongues, but
the dialects of the snakes besides; in fact, I tould him all
about your own swate sell; Shorsha, and many a dispute and
quarrel had we together about our pals, which was the cleverest
fellow, his or mine.</p>
<p><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>&ldquo;Well, after having been wid him about two
months, I quitted him without noise, taking away one of his
tables, and some peas and thimbles; and that I did with a safe
conscience, for he paid me nothing, and was not over free with
the meat and the drink, though I must say of him that he was a
clever fellow, and perfect master of his trade, by which he made
a power of money, and bating his not being able to learn Irish,
and a certain Jewish lisp which he had, a great master of his
tongue, of which he was very proud; so much so, that he once told
me that when he had saved a certain sum of money he meant to
leave off the thimbling business, and enter Parliament; into
which, he said, he could get at any time, through the interest of
a friend of his, a Tory Peer&mdash;my Lord Whitefeather, with
whom, he said, he had occasionally done business.&nbsp; With the
table, and other things which I had taken, I commenced trade on
my own account, having contrived to learn a few of his
tricks.&nbsp; My only capital was the change for half a guinea,
which he had once let fall, and which I picked up, which was all
I could ever get from him: for it was impossible to stale any
money from him, he was so awake, being up to all the tricks of
thaives, having followed the diving trade, as he called it, for a
considerable time.&nbsp; My wish was to make enough by my table
to enable me to return with credit to ould Ireland, where I had
no doubt of being able to get myself ordained as priest; and, in
troth, notwithstanding I was a beginner, and without any
companion to help me, I did tolerably well, getting my meat and
drink, and increasing my small capital, till I came to this
unlucky place of Horncastle, where I was utterly ruined by the
thaif in the rider&rsquo;s dress.&nbsp; And now, Shorsha, I am
after telling you my history; perhaps you will now be telling me
something about yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told Murtagh all about myself that I deemed necessary to
relate, and then asked him what he intended to do; he repeated
that he was utterly ruined, and that he had no prospect before
him but starving, or making away with himself.&nbsp; I inquired
&ldquo;How much would take him to Ireland, and establish him
there with credit&rdquo;.&nbsp; &ldquo;Five pounds,&rdquo; he
answered, adding, &ldquo;but who in the world would be fool
enough to lend me five pounds, unless it be yourself, Shorsha,
who, may be, have not got it; for when you told me about
yourself, you made no boast of the state of your
affairs.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not very rich,&rdquo; I
replied, &ldquo;but I think I can accommodate you with what you
want.&nbsp; I consider myself under great obligations to you,
Murtagh; it was you who instructed me in the language of
<i>Oilein nan Naomha</i>, which has <a name="page296"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 296</span>been the foundation of all my
acquisitions in philology; without you, I should not be what I
am&mdash;Lavengro! which signifies a philologist.&nbsp; Here is
the money, Murtagh,&rdquo; said I, putting my hand into my
pocket, and taking out five pounds, &ldquo;much good may it do
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He took the money, stared at it, and then at
me&mdash;&ldquo;And you mane to give me this,
Shorsha?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is no longer mine to give,&rdquo;
said I; &ldquo;it is yours.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And you give it
to me for the gratitude you bear me?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and for Dungarvon times of
old.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, Shorsha,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;you are a broth of a boy, and I&rsquo;ll take your
benefaction&mdash;five pounds! och, Jasus!&rdquo;&nbsp; He then
put the money in his pocket, and springing up, waved his hat
three times, uttering some old Irish cry; then, sitting down, he
took my hand, and said: &ldquo;Sure, Shorsha, I&rsquo;ll be going
thither; and when I get there, it is turning over another leaf I
will be; I have learnt a thing or two abroad; I will become a
priest; that&rsquo;s the trade, Shorsha! and I will cry out for
repale; that&rsquo;s the cry, Shorsha! and I&rsquo;ll be a fool
no longer.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And what will you do with your
table?&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Faith, I&rsquo;ll be
taking it with me, Shorsha; and when I gets to Ireland,
I&rsquo;ll get it mended, and I will keep it in the house which I
shall have; and when I looks upon it, I will be thinking of all I
have undergone.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You had better leave it
behind you,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;if you take it with you, you
will, perhaps, take up the thimble trade again before you get to
Ireland, and lose the money I am after giving you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No fear of that, Shorsha; never will I play on that table
again, Shorsha, till I get it mended, which shall not be till I
am a priest, and have a house in which to place it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Murtagh and I then went into the town, where we had some
refreshment together, and then parted on our several ways.&nbsp;
I heard nothing of him for nearly a quarter of a century, when a
person who knew him well, coming from Ireland, and staying at my
humble house, told me a great deal about him.&nbsp; He reached
Ireland in safety, soon reconciled himself with his Church, and
was ordained a priest; in the priestly office he acquitted
himself in a way very satisfactory, upon the whole, to his
superiors, having, as he frequently said, learned wisdom
abroad.&nbsp; The Popish Church never fails to turn to account
any particular gift which its servants may possess; and
discovering soon that Murtagh was endowed with considerable
manual dexterity&mdash;proof of which he frequently gave at
cards, and at a singular game which he occasionally played at
thimbles&mdash;it selected him as a very fit person to play the
part of exorcist; and accordingly he travelled through a great
part of Ireland, casting out devils from people <a
name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>possessed,
which he afterwards exhibited, sometimes in the shape of rabbits,
and occasionally birds and fishes.&nbsp; There is a holy island
in a lake in Ireland, to which the people resort at a particular
season of the year.&nbsp; Here Murtagh frequently attended, and
it was here that he performed a cure which will cause his name
long to be remembered in Ireland, delivering a possessed woman of
two demons, which he brandished aloft in his hands, in the shape
of two large eels, and subsequently hurled into the lake, amidst
the shouts of an enthusiastic multitude.&nbsp; Besides playing
the part of an exorcist, he acted that of a politician with
considerable success; he attached himself to the party of the
sire of agitation&mdash;&ldquo;the man of paunch,&rdquo; and
preached and hallooed for repeal with the loudest and best, as
long as repeal was the cry; as soon, however, as the Whigs
attained the helm of Government, and the greater part of the
loaves and fishes&mdash;more politely termed the patronage of
Ireland&mdash;was placed at the disposition of the priesthood,
the tone of Murtagh, like that of the rest of his brother
saggarts, was considerably softened; he even went so far as to
declare that politics were not altogether consistent with
sacerdotal duty; and resuming his exorcisms, which he had for
some time abandoned, he went to the Isle of Holiness, and
delivered a possessed woman of six demons in the shape of white
mice.&nbsp; He, however, again resumed the political mantle in
the year 1848, during the short period of the rebellion of the
so-called Young Irelanders.&nbsp; The priests, though they
apparently sided with this party, did not approve of it, as it
was chiefly formed of ardent young men, fond of what they termed
liberty, and by no means admirers of priestly domination, being
mostly Protestants.&nbsp; Just before the outbreak of this
rebellion, it was determined between the priests and the &mdash;,
that this party should be rendered comparatively innocuous by
being deprived of the sinews of war&mdash;in other words, certain
sums of money which they had raised for their enterprise.&nbsp;
Murtagh was deemed the best qualified person in Ireland to be
entrusted with the delicate office of getting their money from
them.&nbsp; Having received his instructions, he invited the
leaders to his parsonage amongst the mountains, under pretence of
deliberating with them about what was to be done.&nbsp; They
arrived there just before nightfall, dressed in red, yellow and
green, the colours so dear to enthusiastic Irishmen; Murtagh
received them with great apparent cordiality, and entered into a
long discourse with them, promising them the assistance of
himself and order, and received from them a profusion of
thanks.&nbsp; After a time Murtagh, observing, in a jocular tone,
that consulting <a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
298</span>was dull work, proposed a game of cards, and the
leaders, though somewhat surprised, assenting, he went to a
closet, and taking out a pack of cards, laid it upon the table;
it was a strange dirty pack, and exhibited every mark of having
seen very long service.&nbsp; On one of his guests making some
remarks on the &ldquo;ancientness&rdquo; of its appearance,
Murtagh observed that there was a very wonderful history attached
to that pack; it had been presented to him, he said, by a young
gentleman, a disciple of his, to whom, in Dungarvon times of
yore, he had taught the Irish language, and of whom he related
some very extraordinary things; he added that he, Murtagh, had
taken it to &mdash;, where it had once the happiness of being in
the hands of the Holy Father; by a great misfortune, he did not
say what, he had lost possession of it, and had returned without
it, but had some time since recovered it; a nephew of his, who
was being educated at &mdash; for a priest, having found it in a
nook of the college, and sent it to him.</p>
<p>Murtagh and the leaders then played various games with this
pack, more especially one called by the initiated &ldquo;blind
hookey,&rdquo; the result being that at the end of about two
hours the leaders found they had lost one-half of their funds;
they now looked serious, and talked of leaving the house, but
Murtagh begging them to stay supper, they consented.&nbsp; After
supper, at which the guests drank rather freely, Murtagh said
that, as he had not the least wish to win their money, he
intended to give them their revenge; he would not play at cards
with them, he added, but at a funny game of thimbles, at which
they would be sure of winning back their own; then going out, he
brought in a table, tall and narrow, on which placing certain
thimbles and a pea, he proposed that they should stake whatever
they pleased on the almost certainty of finding the pea under the
thimbles.&nbsp; The leaders, after some hesitation, consented,
and were at first eminently successful, winning back the greater
part of what they had lost; after some time, however, Fortune, or
rather Murtagh, turned against them, and then, instead of leaving
off, they doubled and trebled their stakes, and continued doing
so until they had lost nearly the whole of their funds.&nbsp;
Quite furious, they now swore that Murtagh had cheated them, and
insisted on having their property restored to them.&nbsp;
Murtagh, without a word of reply, went to the door, and shouting
into the passage something in Irish, the room was instantly
filled with bogtrotters, each at least six feet high, with a
stout shillelah in his hand.&nbsp; Murtagh then turning to his
guests, asked them what they meant by insulting an anointed
priest; telling them that it was not for the likes of them to
avenge the <a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
299</span>wrongs of Ireland.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been clane
mistaken in the whole of ye,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I supposed ye
Irish, but have found, to my sorrow, that ye are nothing of the
kind; purty fellows to pretend to be Irish, when there is not a
word of Irish on the tongue of any of ye, divil a ha&rsquo;porth;
the illigant young gentleman to whom I taught Irish, in Dungarvon
times of old, though not born in Ireland, has more Irish in him
than any ten of ye.&nbsp; He is the boy to avenge the wrongs of
Ireland, if ever foreigner is to do it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then saying
something to the bogtrotters, they instantly cleared the room of
the young Irelanders, who retired sadly disconcerted;
nevertheless, being very silly young fellows, they hoisted the
standard of rebellion; few, however, joining them, partly because
they had no money, and partly because the priests abused them
with might and main, their rebellion ended in a lamentable
manner; themselves being seized and tried, and though convicted,
not deemed of sufficient importance to be sent to the scaffold,
where they might have had the satisfaction of saying&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Dulce et decorum est
pro patria mori.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My visitor, after saying that of the money won, Murtagh
retained a considerable portion, that a part went to the
hierarchy for what were called church purposes, and that the
&mdash; took the remainder, which it employed in establishing a
newspaper, in which the private characters of the worthiest and
most loyal Protestants in Ireland were traduced and vilified,
concluded his account by observing, that it was the common belief
that Murtagh, having by his services, ecclesiastical and
political, acquired the confidence of the priesthood and favour
of the Government, would, on the first vacancy, be appointed to
the high office of Popish Primate of Ireland.</p>

300</span>CHAPTER XLVII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Leaving</span> Horncastle I bent my steps
in the direction of the east.&nbsp; I walked at a brisk rate, and
late in the evening reached a large town, situate at the entrance
of an extensive firth, or arm of the sea, which prevented my
farther progress eastward.&nbsp; Sleeping that night in the
suburbs of the town, I departed early next morning in the
direction of the south.&nbsp; A walk of about twenty miles
brought me to another large town, situated on a river, where I
again turned towards the east.&nbsp; At the end of the town I was
accosted by a fiery-faced individual, somewhat under the middle
size, dressed as a recruiting sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said the recruiting sergeant,
&ldquo;you are just the kind of person to serve the Honourable
East India Company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had rather the Honourable Company should serve
me,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, young man.&nbsp; Well, the Honourable East
India Company shall serve you&mdash;that&rsquo;s
reasonable.&nbsp; Here, take this shilling; &rsquo;t is
service-money.&nbsp; The Honourable Company engages to serve you,
and you the Honourable Company; both parties shall be thus
served; that&rsquo;s just and reasonable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what must I do for the Company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only go to India; that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what should I do in India?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fight, my brave boy! fight, my youthful
hero!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of country is India?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The finest country in the world!&nbsp; Rivers, bigger
than the Ouse.&nbsp; Hills, higher than anything near
Spalding!&nbsp; Trees&mdash;you never saw such trees!&nbsp;
Fruits&mdash;you never saw such fruits!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the people&mdash;what kind of folk are
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pah!&nbsp; Kauloes&mdash;blacks&mdash;a set of rascals
not worth regarding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kauloes!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;blacks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the recruiting sergeant; &ldquo;and
they call us lolloes, which in their beastly gibberish, means
reds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lolloes!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;reds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the recruiting sergeant,
&ldquo;kauloes and lolloes; and all the lolloes have to do is to
kick and cut down the kauloes, and <a name="page301"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 301</span>take from them their rupees, which
mean silver money.&nbsp; Why do you stare so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;this is the very language of
Mr. Petulengro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pet&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and Tawno Chikno.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tawno Chik&mdash;?&nbsp; I say, young fellow, I
don&rsquo;t like your way of speaking; no, nor your way of
looking.&nbsp; You are mad, sir; you are mad; and what&rsquo;s
this?&nbsp; Why your hair is grey!&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t do for
the Honourable Company&mdash;they like red.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m glad
I didn&rsquo;t give you the shilling.&nbsp; Good-day to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; said I as I proceeded
rapidly along a broad causeway, in the direction of the east,
&ldquo;if Mr. Petulengro and Tawno Chikno came originally from
India.&nbsp; I think I&rsquo;ll go there.&rdquo;</p>

302</span>APPENDIX.</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A WORD FOR </span><span
class="GutSmall"><i>LAVENGRO</i></span><span
class="GutSmall">.</span></h3>
<p>[Shortly after the publication of the first three volumes of
the present work, the author received various letters from
individuals, in which he was requested to state what might be the
drift and tendency of <i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; The author cannot
help thinking it somewhat extraordinary, that, after a preface in
which he was particularly careful to tell the public what the
book was, and the object with which it was written, any fresh
information with respect to it should be required of him.&nbsp;
As, however, all the letters which he has received have been
written in a friendly spirit, he will now endeavour to be a
little more explicit than on a former occasion.]</p>
<p><i>Lavengro</i> is the history up to a certain period of one
of rather a peculiar mind and system of nerves, with an exterior
shy and cold, under which lurk much curiosity, especially with
regard to what is wild and extraordinary, a considerable quantity
of energy and industry, and an unconquerable love of
independence.&nbsp; It narrates his earliest dreams and feelings,
dwells with minuteness on the ways, words and characters of his
father, mother and brother, lingers on the occasional
resting-places of his wandering half-military childhood,
describes the gradual hardening of his bodily frame by robust
exercises, his successive struggles, after his family and himself
have settled down in a small local capital, to obtain knowledge
of every kind, but more particularly philological lore; his
visits to the tent of the Romany chal, and the parlour of the
Anglo-German philosopher; the effect produced upon his character
by his flinging himself into contact with people all widely
differing from each other, but all extraordinary; his reluctance
to settle down to the ordinary pursuits of life; his struggles
after moral truth; his glimpses of God and the obscuration of the
Divine Being, to his mind&rsquo;s eye; and his being cast upon
the world of London by the death of his father, at the age of
nineteen.&nbsp; In the world within a world, the world of London,
it shows him <a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
303</span>playing his part for some time as he best can, in the
capacity of a writer for reviews and magazines, and describes
what he saw and underwent whilst labouring in that capacity; it
represents him, however, as never forgetting that he is the son
of a brave but poor gentleman, and that if he is a hack author,
he is likewise a scholar.&nbsp; It shows him doing no
dishonourable jobs, and proves that if he occasionally associates
with low characters, he does so chiefly to gratify the curiosity
of a scholar.&nbsp; In his conversations with the apple-woman of
London Bridge, the scholar is ever apparent, so again in his
acquaintance with the man of the table; for the book is no raker
up of the uncleanness of London, and if it gives what at first
sight appears refuse, it invariably shows that a pearl of some
kind, generally a philological one, is contained amongst it; it
shows its hero always accompanied by his love of independence,
scorning in the greatest poverty to receive favours from anybody,
and describes him finally rescuing himself from peculiarly
miserable circumstances by writing a book, an original book,
within a week, even as Johnson is said to have written his
<i>Rasselas</i>, and Beckford his <i>Vathek</i>, and tells how,
leaving London, he betakes himself to the roads and fields.</p>
<p>In the country it shows him leading a life of roving
adventure, becoming tinker, gypsy, postillion, ostler;
associating with various kinds of people, chiefly of the lower
classes, whose ways and habits are described; but, though leading
this erratic life, we gather from the book that his habits are
neither vulgar nor vicious, that he still follows to a certain
extent his favourite pursuits, hunting after strange characters,
or analysing strange words and names.&nbsp; At the conclusion of
the fifth volume, which terminates the first part of the history,
it hints that he is about to quit his native land on a grand
philological expedition.</p>
<p>Those who read this book with attention&mdash;and the author
begs to observe that it would be of little utility to read it
hurriedly&mdash;may derive much information with respect to
matters of philology and literature; it will be found treating of
most of the principal languages from Ireland to China, and of the
literature which they contain; and it is particularly minute with
regard to the ways, manners and speech of the English section of
the most extraordinary and mysterious clan or tribe of people to
be found in the whole world&mdash;the children of Roma.&nbsp; But
it contains matters of much more importance than anything in
connection with philology, and the literature and manners of
nations.&nbsp; Perhaps no work was ever offered to the public in
which the kindness and providence of God have been set forth by
more striking <a name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
304</span>examples, or the machinations of priestcraft been more
truly and lucidly exposed, or the dangers which result to a
nation when it abandons itself to effeminacy, and a rage for what
is novel and fashionable, than the present.</p>
<p>With respect to the kindness and providence of God, are they
not exemplified in the case of the old apple-woman and her
son?&nbsp; These are beings in many points bad, but with warm
affections, who, after an agonising separation, are restored to
each other, but not until the hearts of both are changed and
purified by the influence of affliction.&nbsp; Are they not
exemplified in the case of the rich gentleman, who touches
objects in order to avert the evil chance?&nbsp; This being has
great gifts and many amiable qualities, but does not everybody
see that his besetting sin is selfishness?&nbsp; He fixes his
mind on certain objects, and takes inordinate interest in them,
because they are his own, and those very objects, through the
providence of God, which is kindness in disguise, become snakes
and scorpions to whip him.&nbsp; Tired of various pursuits, he at
last becomes an author, and publishes a book, which is very much
admired, and which he loves with his usual inordinate affection;
the book, consequently becomes a viper to him, and at last he
flings it aside and begins another; the book, however, is not
flung aside by the world, who are benefited by it, deriving
pleasure and knowledge from it: so the man who merely wrote to
gratify self, has already done good to others, and got himself an
honourable name.&nbsp; But God will not allow that man to put
that book under his head and use it as a pillow: the book has
become a viper to him, he has banished it, and is about another,
which he finishes and gives to the world; it is a better book
than the first, and every one is delighted with it; but it proves
to the writer a scorpion, because he loves it with inordinate
affection; but it was good for the world that he produced this
book, which stung him as a scorpion.&nbsp; Yes; and good for
himself, for the labour of writing it amused him, and perhaps
prevented him from dying of apoplexy; but the book is banished,
and another is begun, and herein, again, is the providence of God
manifested; the man has the power of producing still, and God
determines that he shall give to the world what remains in his
brain, which he would not do, had he been satisfied with the
second work; he would have gone to sleep upon that as he would
upon the first, for the man is selfish and lazy.&nbsp; In his
account of what he suffered during the composition of this work,
his besetting sin of selfishness is manifest enough; the work on
which he is engaged occupies his every thought, it is his idol,
his deity, it shall be all his own, <a name="page305"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 305</span>he won&rsquo;t borrow a thought from
any one else, and he is so afraid lest, when he publishes it,
that it should be thought that he had borrowed from any one, that
he is continually touching objects, his nervous system, owing to
his extreme selfishness, having become partly deranged.&nbsp; He
is left touching, in order to banish the evil chance from his
book, his deity.&nbsp; No more of his history is given; but does
the reader think that God will permit that man to go to sleep on
his third book, however extraordinary it may be?&nbsp; Assuredly
not.&nbsp; God will not allow that man to rest till he has cured
him to a certain extent of his selfishness, which has, however,
hitherto been very useful to the world.</p>
<p>Then, again, in the tale of Peter Williams, is not the hand of
Providence to be seen?&nbsp; This person commits a sin in his
childhood, utters words of blasphemy, the remembrance of which,
in after life, preying upon his imagination, unfits him for quiet
pursuits, to which he seems to have been naturally inclined; but
for the remembrance of that sin, he would have been Peter
Williams the quiet, respectable Welsh farmer, somewhat fond of
reading the ancient literature of his country in winter evenings,
after his work was done.&nbsp; God, however, was aware that there
was something in Peter Williams to entitle him to assume a higher
calling; he therefore permits this sin, which, though a childish
affair, was yet a sin, and committed deliberately, to prey upon
his mind till he becomes at last an instrument in the hand of
God, a humble Paul, the great preacher, Peter Williams, who,
though he considers himself a reprobate and a castaway, instead
of having recourse to drinking in mad desperation, as many do who
consider themselves reprobates, goes about Wales and England
preaching the word of God, dilating on his power and majesty, and
visiting the sick and afflicted, until God sees fit to restore to
him his peace of mind; which he does not do, however, until that
mind is in a proper condition to receive peace, till it has been
purified by the pain of the one idea which has so long been
permitted to riot in his brain; which pain, however, an angel, in
the shape of a gentle, faithful wife, had occasionally
alleviated; for God is merciful even in the blows which He
bestoweth, and will not permit any one to be tempted beyond the
measure which he can support.&nbsp; And here it will be as well
for the reader to ponder upon the means by which the Welsh
preacher is relieved from his mental misery: he is not relieved
by a text from the Bible, by the words of consolation and wisdom
addressed to him by his angel-minded wife, nor by the preaching
of one yet more eloquent than himself; but by a quotation made by
Lavengro from the life of Mary <a name="page306"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 306</span>Flanders, cut-purse and prostitute,
which life Lavengro had been in the habit of reading at the stall
of his old friend the apple-woman, on London Bridge, who had
herself been very much addicted to the perusal of it, though
without any profit whatever.&nbsp; Should the reader be
dissatisfied with the manner in which Peter Williams is made to
find relief, the author would wish to answer, that the Almighty
frequently accomplishes his purposes by means which appear very
singular to the eyes of men, and at the same time to observe that
the manner in which that relief is obtained, is calculated to
read a lesson to the proud, fanciful and squeamish, who are ever
in a fidget lest they should be thought to mix with low society
or to bestow a moment&rsquo;s attention on publications which are
not what is called of a perfectly unobjectionable
character.&nbsp; Had not Lavengro formed the acquaintance of the
old apple-woman on London Bridge, he would not have had an
opportunity of reading the life of Mary Flanders; and,
consequently, of storing in a memory, which never forgets
anything, a passage which contained a balm for the agonised mind
of poor Peter Williams.&nbsp; The best medicines are not always
found in the finest shops.&nbsp; Suppose, for example, if,
instead of going to London Bridge to read, he had gone to
Albemarle Street, and had received from the proprietors of the
literary establishment in that very fashionable street,
permission to read the publications on the tables of the saloons
there, does the reader think he would have met any balm in those
publications for the case of Peter Williams? does the reader
suppose that he would have found Mary Flanders there?&nbsp; He
would certainly have found that highly unobjectionable
publication <i>Rasselas</i>, and the <i>Spectator</i>, or
<i>Lives of Royal and Illustrious Personages</i>, but, of a
surety, no Mary Flanders; so when Lavengro met with Peter
Williams, he would have been unprovided with a balm to cure his
ulcerated mind, and have parted from him in a way not quite so
satisfactory as the manner in which he took his leave of him; for
it is certain that he might have read <i>Rasselas</i>, and all
the other unexceptionable works to be found in the library of
Albemarle Street, over and over again, before he would have found
any cure in them for the case of Peter Williams.&nbsp; Therefore
the author requests the reader to drop any squeamish nonsense he
may wish to utter about Mary Flanders, and the manner in which
Peter Williams was cured.</p>
<p>And now with respect to the old man who knew Chinese, but
could not tell what was o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; This individual was
a man whose natural powers would have been utterly buried and
lost beneath a mountain of sloth and laziness had not God
determined <a name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
307</span>otherwise.&nbsp; He had in his early years chalked out
for himself a plan of life in which he had his own ease and
self-indulgence solely in view; he had no particular bad passions
to gratify, he only wished to lead an easy, quiet life, just as
if the business of this mighty world could be carried on by
innocent people fond of ease and quiet, or that Providence would
permit innocent, quiet drones to occupy any portion of the earth
and to cumber it.&nbsp; God had at any rate decreed that this man
should not cumber it as a drone.&nbsp; He brings a certain
affliction upon him, the agony of which produces that terrible
whirling of the brain which, unless it is stopped in time,
produces madness; he suffers indescribable misery for a period,
until one morning his attention is arrested, and his curiosity is
aroused, by certain Chinese letters on a teapot; his curiosity
increases more and more, and, of course, in proportion as his
curiosity is increased with respect to the Chinese marks, the
misery in his brain, produced by his mental affliction,
decreases.&nbsp; He sets about learning Chinese, and after the
lapse of many years, during which his mind subsides into a
certain state of tranquillity, he acquires sufficient knowledge
of Chinese to be able to translate with ease the inscriptions to
be found on its singular crockery.&nbsp; Yes, the laziest of
human beings, through the providence of God, a being, too, of
rather inferior capacity, acquires the written part of a language
so difficult that, as Lavengro said on a former occasion, none
but the cleverest people in Europe, the French, are able to
acquire it.&nbsp; But God did not intend that man should merely
acquire Chinese.&nbsp; He intended that he should be of use to
his species, and by the instrumentality of the first Chinese
inscription which he translates, the one which first arrested his
curiosity, he is taught the duties of hospitality; yes, by means
of an inscription in the language of a people, who have scarcely
an idea of hospitality themselves, God causes the slothful man to
play a useful and beneficent part in the world, relieving
distressed wanderers, and, amongst others, Lavengro
himself.&nbsp; But a striking indication of the man&rsquo;s
surprising sloth is still apparent in what he omits to do; he has
learnt Chinese, the most difficult of languages, and he practises
acts of hospitality, because he believes himself enjoined to do
so by the Chinese inscription, but he cannot tell the hour of the
day by the clock within his house; he can get on, he thinks, very
well without being able to do so; therefore, from this one
omission, it is easy to come to a conclusion as to what a
sluggard&rsquo;s part the man would have played in life, but for
the dispensation of Providence; nothing but extreme agony could
have induced <a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
308</span>such a man to do anything useful.&nbsp; He still
continues, with all he has acquired, with all his usefulness, and
with all his innocence of character, without any proper sense of
religion, though he has attained a rather advanced age.&nbsp; If
it be observed, that this want of religion is a great defect in
the story, the author begs leave to observe that he cannot help
it.&nbsp; Lavengro relates the lives of people so far as they
were placed before him, but no further.&nbsp; It was certainly a
great defect in so good a man to be without religion; it was
likewise a great defect in so learned a man not to be able to
tell what was o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; It is probable that God, in
His loving kindness, will not permit that man to go out of the
world without religion; who knows but some powerful minister of
the Church, full of zeal for the glory of God, will illume that
man&rsquo;s dark mind; perhaps some clergyman will come to the
parish who will visit him and teach him his duty to his
God.&nbsp; Yes, it is very probable that such a man, before he
dies, will have been made to love his God; whether he will ever
learn to know what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock, is another
matter.&nbsp; It is probable that he will go out of the world
without knowing what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; It is not so
necessary to be able to tell the time of day by the clock as to
know one&rsquo;s God through His inspired word; a man cannot get
to heaven without religion, but a man can get there very
comfortably without knowing what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>But, above all, the care and providence of God are manifested
in the case of Lavengro himself, by the manner in which he is
enabled to make his way in the world up to a certain period,
without falling a prey either to vice or poverty.&nbsp; In his
history, there is a wonderful illustration of part of the text,
quoted by his mother: &ldquo;I have been young, but now am old,
yet never saw I the righteous forsaken, or his seed begging
bread&rdquo;.&nbsp; He is the son of good and honourable parents,
but at the critical period of life, that of entering into the
world, he finds himself without any earthly friend to help him,
yet he manages to make his way; he does not become a Captain in
the Life Guards, it is true, nor does he get into Parliament, nor
does the last volume conclude in the most satisfactory and
unobjectionable manner, by his marrying a dowager countess, as
that wise man Addison did, or by his settling down as a great
country gentleman, perfectly happy and contented, like the very
moral Roderick Random, or the equally estimable Peregrine Pickle;
he is hack author, gypsy, tinker and postillion, yet, upon the
whole, he seems to be quite as happy as the younger sons of most
earls, to have as high feelings of honour; and when the reader
loses sight of him, he <a name="page309"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 309</span>has money in his pocket honestly
acquired, to enable him to commence a journey quite as laudable
as those which the younger sons of earls generally
undertake.&nbsp; Surely all this is a manifestation of the
kindness and providence of God; and yet he is not a religious
person; up to the time when the reader loses sight of him, he is
decidedly not a religious person; he has glimpses, it is true, of
that God who does not forsake him, but he prays very seldom, is
not fond of going to church; and, though he admires Tate and
Brady&rsquo;s version of the Psalms, his admiration is rather
caused by the beautiful poetry which that version contains than
the religion; yet his tale is not finished&mdash;like the tale of
the gentleman who touched objects, and that of the old man who
knew Chinese without knowing what was o&rsquo;clock; perhaps,
like them, he is destined to become religious, and to have,
instead of occasional glimpses frequent and distinct views of his
God; yet, though he may become religious, it is hardly to be
expected that he will become a very precise and straightlaced
person; it is probable that he will retain, with his scholarship,
something of his gypsyism, his predilection for the hammer and
tongs, and perhaps some inclination to put on certain gloves, not
white kid, with any friend who may be inclined for a little old
English diversion, and a readiness to take a glass of ale, with
plenty of malt in it, and as little hop as may well be&mdash;ale
at least two years old&mdash;with the aforesaid friend, when the
diversion is over; for, as it is the belief of the writer that a
person may get to heaven very comfortably without knowing
what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock, so it is his belief that he will not
be refused admission there, because to the last he has been fond
of healthy and invigorating exercises, and felt a willingness to
partake of any of the good things which it pleases the Almighty
to put within the reach of his children during their sojourn upon
earth.</p>
<h3><a name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
310</span>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ON PRIESTCRAFT.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> writer will now say a few words
about priestcraft, and the machinations of Rome, and will
afterwards say something about himself, and his motives for
writing against them.</p>
<p>With respect to Rome, and her machinations, much valuable
information can be obtained from particular parts of
<i>Lavengro</i>, and its sequel.&nbsp; Shortly before the time
when the hero of the book is launched into the world, the Popish
agitation in England had commenced.&nbsp; The Popish propaganda
had determined to make a grand attempt on England; Popish priests
were scattered over the land, doing the best they could to make
converts to the old superstition.&nbsp; With the plans of Rome,
and her hopes, and the reasons on which those hopes are grounded,
the hero of the book becomes acquainted, during an expedition
which he makes into the country, from certain conversations which
he holds with a priest in a dingle, in which the hero had taken
up his residence; he likewise learns from the same person much of
the secret history of the Roman See, and many matters connected
with the origin and progress of the Popish superstition.&nbsp;
The individual with whom he holds these conversations is a
learned, intelligent, but highly-unprincipled person, of a
character however very common amongst the priests of Rome, who in
general are people void of all religion, and who, notwithstanding
they are tied to Rome by a band which they have neither the power
nor wish to break, turn her and her practices, over their cups
with their confidential associates, to a ridicule only exceeded
by that to which they turn those who become the dupes of their
mistress and themselves.</p>
<p>It is now necessary that the writer should say something with
respect to himself, and his motives for waging war against
Rome.&nbsp; First of all, with respect to himself, he wishes to
state, that to the very last moment of his life, he will do and
say all that in his power may be to hold up to contempt and
execration the priestcraft and practices of Rome; there is,
perhaps, no person better acquainted than himself, not even among
the choicest spirits of the priesthood, with the origin and
history of Popery.&nbsp; From <a name="page311"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 311</span>what he saw and heard of Popery in
England, at a very early period of his life, his curiosity was
aroused, and he spared himself no trouble, either by travel or
study, to make himself well acquainted with it in all its phases,
the result being a hatred of it, which he hopes and trusts he
shall retain till the moment when his spirit quits the
body.&nbsp; Popery is the great lie of the world; a source from
which more misery and social degradation have flowed upon the
human race, than from all the other sources from which those
evils come.&nbsp; It is the oldest of all superstitions; and
though in Europe it assumes the name of Christianity, it existed
and flourished amidst the Himalayan hills at least two thousand
years before the real Christ was born in Bethlehem of Judea; in a
word, it is Buddhism; and let those who may be disposed to doubt
this assertion, compare the Popery of Rome, and the superstitious
practices of its followers, with the doings of the priests who
surround the grand Lama; and the mouthings, bellowing, turnings
round, and, above all, the penances of the followers of Buddh
with those of Roman devotees.&nbsp; But he is not going to dwell
here on this point; it is dwelt upon at tolerable length in the
text, and has likewise been handled with extraordinary power by
the pen of the gifted but irreligious Volney; moreover, the
<i>&eacute;lite</i> of the Roman priesthood are perfectly well
aware that their system is nothing but Buddhism under a slight
disguise, and the European world in general has entertained for
some time past an inkling of the fact.</p>
<p>And now a few words with respect to the motives of the writer
for expressing a hatred for Rome.</p>
<p>This expressed abhorrence of the author for Rome might be
entitled to little regard, provided it were possible to attribute
it to any self-interested motive.&nbsp; There have been professed
enemies of Rome, or of this or that system; but their professed
enmity may frequently be traced to some cause which does them
little credit; but the writer of these lines has no motive, and
can have no motive, for his enmity to Rome, save the abhorrence
of an honest heart for what is false, base and cruel.&nbsp; A
certain clergyman wrote with much heat against the Papists in the
time of &mdash; <a name="citation311a"></a><a
href="#footnote311a" class="citation">[311a]</a> who was known to
favour the Papists, but was not expected to continue long in
office, and whose supposed successor, <a
name="citation311b"></a><a href="#footnote311b"
class="citation">[311b]</a> the person, indeed, who did succeed
him, was thought to be hostile to the Papists.&nbsp; This divine,
who obtained a rich benefice from the successor of &mdash; <a
name="citation311c"></a><a href="#footnote311c"
class="citation">[311c]</a> who during &mdash;&rsquo;s <a
name="citation311d"></a><a href="#footnote311d"
class="citation">[311d]</a> time had always opposed <a
name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>him in
everything he proposed to do, and who, of course, during that
time affected to be very inimical to Popery&mdash;this divine
might well be suspected of having a motive equally creditable for
writing against the Papists, as that which induced him to write
for them, as soon as his patron, who eventually did something
more for him, <a name="citation312a"></a><a href="#footnote312a"
class="citation">[312a]</a> had espoused their cause; but what
motive, save an honest one, can the present writer have, for
expressing an abhorrence of Popery?&nbsp; He is no clergyman, and
consequently can expect neither benefices nor bishoprics,
supposing it were the fashion of the present, or likely to be the
fashion of any future administration to reward clergymen with
benefices or bishoprics, who, in the defence of the religion of
their country write, or shall write, against Popery, and not to
reward those who write, or shall write, in favour of it, and all
its nonsense and abominations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if not a clergyman, he is the servant of a certain
society which has the overthrow of Popery in view, and
therefore,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; This assertion, which has been
frequently made, is incorrect, even as those who have made it
probably knew it to be.&nbsp; He is the servant of no society
whatever.&nbsp; He eats his own bread, <a
name="citation312b"></a><a href="#footnote312b"
class="citation">[312b]</a> and is one of the very few men in
England who are independent in every sense of the word.</p>
<p>It is true he went to Spain with the colours of that society
on his hat&mdash;oh! the blood glows in his veins! oh! the marrow
awakes in his old bones when he thinks of what he accomplished in
Spain in the cause of religion and civilisation with the colours
of that society in his hat, and its weapon in his hand, even the
sword of the word of God; how with that weapon he hewed left and
right, making the priests fly before him, and run away squeaking:
&ldquo;<i>Vaya</i>! <i>qu&eacute; demonio es
este</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Ay, and when he thinks of the plenty of
Bible swords which he left behind him, destined to prove, and
which have already proved, pretty calthrops in the heels of
Popery.&nbsp; &ldquo;Halloo!&nbsp; Batuschca,&rdquo; he exclaimed
the other night on reading an article in a newspaper; <a
name="citation312c"></a><a href="#footnote312c"
class="citation">[312c]</a> &ldquo;what do you think of the
present doings in Spain?&nbsp; Your old friend the zingaro, the
gitano who rode about Spain, to say nothing of Galicia, with the
Greek Buchini behind him as his squire, had a hand in bringing
them about; there are many brave Spaniards connected with the
present movement <a name="citation312d"></a><a
href="#footnote312d" class="citation">[312d]</a> who took Bibles
from his hands, and read them and profited by them, learning from
the inspired page the <a name="page313"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 313</span>duties of one man towards another,
and the real value of a priesthood and their head, who set at
nought the Word of God, and think only of their own temporal
interests; ay, and who learned Gitano&mdash;their own
Gitano&mdash;from the lips of the London Calor&oacute;, and also
songs in the said Gitano, very fit to dumbfounder your
semi-Buddhist priests when they attempt to bewilder
people&rsquo;s minds with their school-logic and
pseudo-ecclesiastical nonsense, songs such as&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&lsquo;Un
Erajai<br />
Sinaba chibando un sermon&mdash;&rsquo;.&rdquo; <a
name="citation313"></a><a href="#footnote313"
class="citation">[313]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But with that society he has long since ceased to have any
connection; he bade it adieu with feelings of love and admiration
more than fourteen years ago, so in continuing to assault Popery,
no hopes of interest founded on that society can sway his
mind&mdash;interest! who, with worldly interest in view, would
ever have anything to do with that society?&nbsp; It is poor and
supported, like its founder Christ, by poor people; and so far
from having political influence, it is in such disfavour, and has
ever been, with the dastardly great, to whom the government of
England has for many years past been confided, that the having
borne its colours only for a month would be sufficient to exclude
any man, whatever his talents, his learning, or his courage may
be, from the slightest chance of being permitted to serve his
country either for fee, or without.&nbsp; A fellow who unites in
himself the bankrupt trader, the broken author, or rather
book-maker, and the laughed-down single speech spouter of the
House of Commons, may look forward, always supposing that at one
time he has been a foaming radical, to the government of an
important colony.&nbsp; Ay, an ancient fox who has lost his tail
may, provided he has a score of radical <a
name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 314</span>friends,
who will swear that he can bark Chinese, though Chinese is not
barked but sung, be forced upon a Chinese colony, though it is
well known that to have lost one&rsquo;s tail, is considered by
the Chinese in general as an irreparable infamy, whilst to have
been once connected with a certain society, to which, to its
honour be it said, all the radical party are vehemently hostile,
would be quite sufficient to keep any one not only from a
government, but something much less, even though he could
translate the rhymed <i>Sessions of Hariri</i>, and were versed,
still retaining his tail, in the two languages in which
Kien-Loung wrote his Eulogium on Moukden, that piece which,
translated by Amyot, the learned Jesuit, won the applause of the
celebrated Voltaire.</p>
<p>No! were the author influenced by hopes of fee or reward, he
would, instead of writing against Popery, write for it; all the
trumpery titled&mdash;he will not call them great
again&mdash;would then be for him, and their masters the
radicals, with their hosts of newspapers, would be for him, more
especially if he would commence maligning the society whose
colours he had once on his hat&mdash;a society which, as the
priest says in the text, is one of the very few Protestant
institutions for which the Popish Church entertains any fear, and
consequently respect, as it respects nothing which it does not
fear.&nbsp; The writer said that certain &ldquo;rulers&rdquo;
would never forgive him for having been connected with that
society; he went perhaps too far in saying
&ldquo;never&rdquo;.&nbsp; It is probable that they would take
him into favour on one condition, which is, that he should turn
his pen and his voice against that society; such a mark &ldquo;of
a better way of thinking,&rdquo; would perhaps induce them to
give him a government, nearly as good as that which they gave to
a certain ancient radical fox at the intercession of his radical
friends (who were bound to keep him from the pauper&rsquo;s
kennel), after he had promised to foam, bark and snarl at
corruption no more; he might even entertain hopes of succeeding,
nay, of superseding, the ancient creature in his government; but
even were he as badly off as he is well off, he would do no such
thing.&nbsp; He would rather exist on crusts and water; he has
often done so, and been happy; nay, he would rather starve than
be a rogue&mdash;for even the feeling of starvation is happiness
compared with what he feels who knows himself to be a rogue,
provided he has any feeling at all.&nbsp; What is the use of a
mitre or knighthood to a man who has betrayed his
principles?&nbsp; What is the use of a gilt collar, nay, even of
a pair of scarlet breeches, to a fox who has lost his tail?&nbsp;
Oh! the horror which haunts the mind of the fox who has lost his
tail; and with reason, for his very mate loathes <a
name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span>him and
more especially if, like himself, she has lost her brush.&nbsp;
Oh! the horror which haunts the mind of the two-legged rogue who
has parted with his principles, or those which he
professed&mdash;for what?&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll suppose a
government.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the use of a government, if, the
next day after you have received it, you are obliged for very
shame to scurry off to it with the hoot of every honest man
sounding in your ears?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lightly liar leaped and away

</blockquote>
<p>But bigotry, it has been said, makes the author write against
Popery; and thorough-going bigotry, indeed, will make a person
say or do anything.&nbsp; But the writer is a very pretty bigot
truly!&nbsp; Where will the public find traces of bigotry in
anything he has written?&nbsp; He has written against Rome with
all his heart, with all his mind, with all his soul, and with all
his strength; but as a person may be quite honest, and speak and
write against Rome, in like manner he may speak and write against
her, and be quite free from bigotry; though it is impossible for
any one but a bigot or a bad man to write or speak in her praise;
her doctrines, actions and machinations being what they are.</p>
<p>Bigotry!&nbsp; The author was born, and has always continued,
in the wrong Church for bigotry, the quiet, unpretending Church
of England; a Church which, had it been a bigoted Church, and not
long suffering almost to a fault, might with its opportunities,
as the priest says in the text, have stood in a very different
position from that which it occupies at present.&nbsp; No! let
those who are in search of bigotry, seek for it in a Church very
different from the inoffensive Church of England, which never
encourages cruelty or calumny.&nbsp; Let them seek for it amongst
the members of the Church of Rome, and more especially amongst
those who have renegaded to it.&nbsp; There is nothing, however
false and horrible, which a pervert to Rome will not say for his
Church, and which his priests will not encourage him in saying;
and there is nothing, however horrible&mdash;the more horrible
indeed and revolting to human nature, the more eager he would be
to do it&mdash;which he will not do for it and which his priests
will not encourage him in doing.</p>
<p>Of the readiness which converts to Popery exhibit to sacrifice
all the ties of blood and affection on the shrine of their
newly-adopted religion, there is a curious illustration in the
work of Luigi Pulci.&nbsp; This man, who was born in Florence in
the year 1432, and who was deeply versed in the Bible, composed a
poem, called the <i>Morgante Maggiore</i>, which he recited at
the table of <a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
316</span>Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici, the great patron of Italian
genius.&nbsp; It is a mock-heroic and religious poem, in which
the legends of knight-errantry, and of the Popish Church, are
turned to unbounded ridicule.&nbsp; The pretended hero of it is a
converted giant, called Morgante; though his adventures do not
occupy the twentieth part of the poem, the principal personages
being Charlemagne, Orlando, and his cousin Rinaldo of
Montalban.&nbsp; Morgante has two brothers, both of them giants,
and in the first canto of the poem, Morgante is represented with
his brothers as carrying on a feud with the abbot and monks of a
certain convent, built upon the confines of heathenesse; the
giants being in the habit of flinging down stones, or rather huge
rocks, on the convent.&nbsp; Orlando, however, who is banished
from the court of Charlemagne, arriving at the convent,
undertakes to destroy them, and, accordingly, kills Passamonte
and Alabastro, and converts Morgante, whose mind had been
previously softened by a vision, in which the &ldquo;Blessed
Virgin&rdquo; figures.&nbsp; No sooner is he converted than, as a
sign of his penitence, what does he do, but hastens and cuts off
the hands of his two brothers, saying&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Io vo&rsquo; tagliar le mani &agrave; tutti
quanti<br />
E porterolle &agrave; que&rsquo; monaci santi&rdquo;. <a
name="citation316a"></a><a href="#footnote316a"
class="citation">[316a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he does cut off the hands of his brethren, and carries
them to the abbot, who blesses him for so doing.&nbsp; Pulci here
is holding up to ridicule and execration the horrid butchery or
betrayal of friends by popish converts, and the encouragement
they receive from the priest.&nbsp; No sooner is a person
converted to Popery, than his principal thought is how he can
bring the hands and feet of his brethren, however harmless they
may be, and different from the giants, to the &ldquo;holy
priests,&rdquo; who, if he manages to do so, never fail to praise
him, saying to the miserable wretch, as the abbot said to
Morgante:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Tu sarai or perfetto e veto amico<br />
A Cristo, quauto tu gli eri nemico&rdquo;. <a
name="citation316b"></a><a href="#footnote316b"
class="citation">[316b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can the English public deny the justice of Pulci&rsquo;s
illustration, after something which it has lately
witnessed?&nbsp; Has it not seen equivalents for the hands and
feet of brothers carried by popish perverts to the &ldquo;holy
priests,&rdquo; and has it not seen the manner in which the
offering has been received?&nbsp; Let those who are in quest of
Bigotry seek for it among the perverts to Rome, and not amongst
those who, born in the pale of the Church of England, have always
continued in it.</p>

317</span>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ON FOREIGN NONSENSE.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">With</span> respect to the third point,
various lessons which the book reads to the nation at large, and
which it would be well for the nation to ponder and profit
by.</p>
<p>There are many species of nonsense to which the nation is much
addicted, and of which the perusal of <i>Lavengro</i> ought to
give them a wholesome shame.&nbsp; First of all, with respect to
the foreign nonsense so prevalent now in England.&nbsp; The hero
is a scholar; but, though possessed of a great many tongues, he
affects to be neither Frenchman, nor German, nor this or that
foreigner; he is one who loves his country, and the language and
literature of his country, and speaks up for each and all when
there is occasion to do so.&nbsp; Now what is the case with nine
out of ten amongst those of the English who study foreign
languages?&nbsp; No sooner have they picked up a smattering of
this or that speech than they begin to abuse their own country,
and everything connected with it, more especially its
language.&nbsp; This is particularly the case with those who call
themselves German students.&nbsp; It is said, and the writer
believes with truth, that when a woman falls in love with a
particularly ugly fellow, she squeezes him with ten times more
zest than she would a handsome one, if captivated by him.&nbsp;
So it is with these German students; no sooner have they taken
German in hand than there is nothing like German.&nbsp; Oh, the
dear, delightful German!&nbsp; How proud I am that it is now my
own, and that its divine literature is within my reach!&nbsp; And
all this whilst mumbling the most uncouth speech, and crunching
the most crabbed literature in Europe.&nbsp; The writer is not an
exclusive admirer of everything English; he does not advise his
country people never to go abroad, never to study foreign
languages, and he does not wish to persuade them that there is
nothing beautiful or valuable in foreign literature; he only
wishes that they would not make themselves fools with respect to
foreign people, foreign languages or reading; that if they chance
to have been in Spain, and have picked up a little Spanish, they
would not affect the airs of Spaniards; that if males they would
not make Tom-fools of themselves by sticking cigars into their
mouths, dressing themselves <a name="page318"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 318</span>in <i>zamarras</i>, and saying,
<i>carajo</i>! <a name="citation318"></a><a href="#footnote318"
class="citation">[318]</a> and if females that they would not
make zanies of themselves by sticking cigars into their mouths,
flinging mantillas over their heads, and by saying <i>carai</i>,
and perhaps <i>carajo</i> too; or if they have been in France or
Italy, and have picked up a little French or Italian, they would
not affect to be French or Italians; and particularly, after
having been a month or two in Germany, or picked up a little
German in England, they would not make themselves foolish about
everything German, as the Anglo-German in the book does&mdash;a
real character, the founder of the Anglo-German school in
England, and the cleverest Englishman who ever talked or wrote
encomiastic nonsense about Germany and the Germans.&nbsp; Of all
infatuations connected with what is foreign, the infatuation
about everything that is German, to a certain extent prevalent in
England, is assuredly the most ridiculous.&nbsp; One can find
something like a palliation for people making themselves somewhat
foolish about particular languages, literatures and people.&nbsp;
The Spanish certainly is a noble language, and there is something
wild and captivating in the Spanish character, and its literature
contains the grand book of the world.&nbsp; French is a manly
language.&nbsp; The French are the great martial people in the
world; and French literature is admirable in many respects.&nbsp;
Italian is a sweet language, and of beautiful
simplicity&mdash;its literature perhaps the first in the
world.&nbsp; The Italians!&mdash;wonderful men have sprung up in
Italy.&nbsp; Italy is not merely famous for painters, poets,
musicians, singers and linguists&mdash;the greatest linguist the
world ever saw, the late Cardinal Mezzofanti, was an Italian; but
it is celebrated for men&mdash;men emphatically speaking:
Columbus was an Italian, Alexander Farnese was an Italian, so was
the mightiest of the mighty, Napoleon Bonaparte; but the German
language, German literature, and the Germans!&nbsp; The writer
has already stated his opinion with respect to German; he does
not speak from ignorance or prejudice; he has heard German
spoken, and many other languages.&nbsp; German literature!&nbsp;
He does not speak from ignorance, he has read that and many a
literature, and he repeats&mdash;however, he acknowledges that
there is one fine poem in the German language, that poem is the
<i>Oberon</i>; a poem, by-the-bye, ignored by the Germans&mdash;a
speaking fact&mdash;and of course, by the Anglo-Germanists.&nbsp;
The Germans! he has been amongst them, and amongst many other
nations, and confesses that his opinion of the Germans, as men,
is a very low one.&nbsp; Germany, it <a name="page319"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 319</span>is true, has produced one very great
man, the monk who fought the Pope, and nearly knocked him down;
but this man his country-men&mdash;a telling fact&mdash;affect to
despise, and, of course, the Anglo-Germanists: the father of
Anglo-Germanism was very fond of inveighing against Luther.</p>
<p>The madness, or rather foolery, of the English for foreign
customs, dresses and languages, is not an affair of to-day, or
yesterday&mdash;it is of very ancient date, and was very properly
exposed nearly three centuries ago by one Andrew Borde, who under
the picture of a &ldquo;Naked man, with a pair of shears in one
hand, and a roll of cloth in the other,&rdquo; inserted the
following lines along with others:&mdash;<a
name="citation319"></a><a href="#footnote319"
class="citation">[319]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>I am an Englishman, and naked I stand here,<br />
Musing in my mind what garment I shall weare;<br />
For now I will weare this, and now I will weare that,<br />
Now I will weare, I cannot tell what.<br />
All new fashions be pleasant to mee,<br />
I will have them, whether I thrive or thee;<br />
What do I care if all the world me fail?<br />
I will have a garment [shall] reach to my taile;<br />
Then am I a minion, for I weare the new guise.<br />
The next yeare after I hope to be wise,<br />
Not only in wearing my gorgeous array,<br />
For I will go to learning a whole summer&rsquo;s day,<br />
I will learn Latine, Hebrew, Greek, and French,<br />
And I will learn Dutch, sitting on my bench.<br />
I had no peere if to myself I were true,<br />
Because I am not so, divers times do I rue.<br />
Yet I lacke nothing, I have all things at will<br />
If I were wise and would hold myself still,<br />
And meddle with no matters but to me pertaining,<br />
But ever to be true to God and my King.<br />
But I have such matters rowling in my pate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That I will and do &mdash; &mdash; I cannot tell
what, etc.</p>

320</span>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ON GENTILITY NONSENSE.</span></h3>
<p>What is gentility?&nbsp; People in different stations in
England entertain different ideas of what is genteel, <a
name="citation320"></a><a href="#footnote320"
class="citation">[320]</a> but it must be something gorgeous,
glittering or tawdry, to be considered genteel by any of
them.&nbsp; The beau-ideal of the English aristocracy, of course
with some exceptions, is some young fellow with an imperial
title, a military personage of course, for what is military is so
particularly genteel, with flaming epaulets, a cocked hat and
plume, a prancing charger, and a band of fellows called generals
and colonels, with flaming epaulets, cocked hats and plumes, and
prancing chargers vapouring behind him.&nbsp; It was but lately
that the daughter of an English marquis was heard to say, that
the sole remaining wish of her heart&mdash;she had known
misfortunes, and was not far from fifty&mdash;was to be
introduced to&mdash;whom?&nbsp; The Emperor of Austria!&nbsp; The
sole remaining wish of the heart of one who ought to have been
thinking of the grave and judgment, was to be introduced to the
miscreant who had caused the blood of noble Hungarian females to
be whipped out of their shoulders, for no other crime than
devotion to their country, and its tall and heroic sons.&nbsp;
The middle classes&mdash;of course there are some
exceptions&mdash;admire the aristocracy, and consider them pinks,
the <a name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
321</span>aristocracy who admire the Emperor of Austria, and
adored the Emperor of Russia, till he became old, ugly and
unfortunate, when their adoration instantly terminated; for what
is more ungenteel than age, ugliness and misfortune!&nbsp; The
beau-ideal with those of the lower classes, with peasants and
mechanics, is some flourishing railroad contractor: look, for
example, how they worship Mr. Flamson.&nbsp; This person makes
his grand d&eacute;but in the year &rsquo;thirty-nine, at a
public meeting in the principal room of a country inn.&nbsp; He
has come into the neighbourhood with the character of a man worth
a million pounds, who is to make everybody&rsquo;s fortune; at
this time, however, he is not worth a shilling of his own, though
he flashes about dexterously three or four thousand pounds, part
of which sum he has obtained by specious pretences, and part from
certain individuals who are his confederates.&nbsp; But in the
year &rsquo;forty-nine, he is really in possession of the fortune
which he and his agents pretended he was worth ten years
before&mdash;he is worth a million pounds.&nbsp; By what means
has he come by them?&nbsp; By railroad contracts, for which he
takes care to be paid in hard cash before he attempts to perform
them, and to carry out which he makes use of the sweat and blood
of wretches who, since their organisation, have introduced crimes
and language into England to which it was previously almost a
stranger&mdash;by purchasing, with paper, shares by hundreds in
the schemes to execute which he contracts, and which are of his
own devising; which shares he sells as soon as they are at a high
premium, to which they are speedily forced by means of
paragraphs, inserted by himself and agents, in newspapers devoted
to his interest, utterly reckless of the terrible depreciation to
which they are almost instantly subjected.&nbsp; But he is worth
a million pounds, there can be no doubt of the fact&mdash;he has
not made people&rsquo;s fortunes, at least those whose fortunes
it was said he would make; he has made them away; but his own he
has made, emphatically made it; he is worth a million
pounds.&nbsp; Hurrah for the millionnaire!&nbsp; The clown who
views the pandemonium of red brick which he has built on the
estate which he has purchased in the neighbourhood of the place
of his grand d&eacute;but in which every species of architecture,
Greek, Indian and Chinese, is employed in caricature&mdash;who
hears of the grand entertainment he gives at Christmas in the
principal dining-room, the hundred wax-candles, the waggon-load
of plate, and the oceans of wine which form parts of it, and
above all the two ostrich poults, one at the head, and the other
at the foot of the table, exclaims: &ldquo;Well! if he
a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t bang up, I don&rsquo;t know who be; why he
beats my lord hollow!&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page322"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 322</span>The mechanic of the borough town,
who sees him dashing through the streets in an open landau, drawn
by four milk-white horses, amidst its attendant out-riders; his
wife, a monster of a woman, by his side, stout as the wife of
Tamerlane, who weighed twenty stone, and bedizened out like her
whose person shone with the jewels of plundered Persia, stares
with silent wonder, and at last exclaims: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
man for my vote!&rdquo;&nbsp; You tell the clown that the man of
the mansion has contributed enormously to corrupt the rural
innocence of England; you point to an incipient branch railroad,
from around which the accents of Gomorrah are sounding, and beg
him to listen for a moment, and then close his ears.&nbsp; Hodge
scratches his head and says: &ldquo;Well, I have nothing to say
to that; all I known is that he is bang up, and I wish I were
he&rdquo;; perhaps he will add&mdash;a Hodge has been known to
add&mdash;&ldquo;He has been kind enough to put my son on that
very railroad; &rsquo;tis true the company is somewhat queer, and
the work rather killing, but he gets there half a crown a day,
whereas from the farmers he would only get
eighteenpence.&rdquo;&nbsp; You remind the mechanic that the man
in the landau has been the ruin of thousands, and you mention
people whom he himself knows, people in various grades of life,
widows and orphans amongst them, whose little all he has
dissipated, and whom he has reduced to beggary by inducing them
to become sharers in his delusive schemes.&nbsp; But the mechanic
says: &ldquo;Well, the more fools they to let themselves be
robbed.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t call that kind of thing robbery,
I merely call it out-witting; and everybody in this free country
has a right to outwit others if he can.&nbsp; What a turn-out he
has!&rdquo;&nbsp; One was once heard to add: &ldquo;I never saw a
more genteel-looking man in all my life except one, and that was
a gentleman&rsquo;s walley, who was much like him.&nbsp; It is
true he is rather undersized, but then, madam, you know, makes up
for all.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
323</span>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">SUBJECT OF GENTILITY
CONTINUED.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the last chapter have been
exhibited specimens of gentility, so considered by different
classes; by one class, power, youth and epaulets are considered
the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of gentility; by another class, pride,
stateliness and title; by another, wealth and flaming
tawdriness.&nbsp; But what constitutes a gentleman?&nbsp; It is
easy to say at once what constitutes a gentleman, and there are
no distinctions in what is gentlemanly, <a
name="citation323"></a><a href="#footnote323"
class="citation">[323]</a> as there are in what is genteel.&nbsp;
The characteristics of a gentleman are high feeling&mdash;a
determination never to take a cowardly advantage of
another&mdash;a liberal education&mdash;absence of narrow
views&mdash;generosity and courage, propriety of behaviour.&nbsp;
Now a person may be genteel according to one or another of the
three standards described above, and not possess one of the
characteristics of a gentleman.&nbsp; Is the emperor a gentleman,
with spatters of blood on his clothes, scourged from the backs of
noble Hungarian women?&nbsp; Are the aristocracy gentlefolks, who
admire him?&nbsp; Is Mr. Flamson a gentleman, although he has a
million pounds?&nbsp; No! cowardly miscreants, admirers of
cowardly miscreants, and people who make a million pounds by
means compared with which those employed to make fortunes by the
getters up of the South Sea Bubble might be called honest
dealing, are decidedly not gentlefolks.&nbsp; Now as it is
clearly demonstrable that a person may be perfectly genteel
according to some standard or other, and yet be no gentleman, so
is it demonstrable that a person may have no pretensions to
gentility, and yet be a gentleman.&nbsp; For example, there is
Lavengro!&nbsp; Would the admirers of the emperor, or the
admirers of those who admire the emperor, or the admirers of Mr.
Flamson, call him genteel? and gentility with them is
everything!&nbsp; Assuredly they would not; and assuredly they
would consider him respectively as a being to be shunned,
despised, or <a name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
324</span>hooted.&nbsp; Genteel!&nbsp; Why at one time he is a
hack author&mdash;writes reviewals for eighteenpence a
page&mdash;edits a Newgate chronicle.&nbsp; At another he wanders
the country with a face grimy from occasionally mending kettles;
and there is no evidence that his clothes are not seedy and torn,
and his shoes down at the heel; but by what process of reasoning
will they prove that he is no gentleman?&nbsp; Is he not
learned?&nbsp; Has he not generosity and courage?&nbsp; Whilst a
hack author, does he pawn the books entrusted to him to
review?&nbsp; Does he break his word to his publisher?&nbsp; Does
he write begging letters?&nbsp; Does he get clothes or lodgings
without paying for them?&nbsp; Again, whilst a wanderer, does he
insult helpless women on the road with loose proposals or ribald
discourse?&nbsp; Does he take what is not his own from the
hedges?&nbsp; Does he play on the fiddle, or make faces in
public-houses, in order to obtain pence or beer? or does he call
for liquor, swallow it, and then say to a widowed landlady,
&ldquo;Mistress, I have no brass?&rdquo;&nbsp; In a word, what
vice and crime does he perpetrate&mdash;what low acts does he
commit?&nbsp; Therefore, with his endowments, who will venture to
say that he is no gentleman?&mdash;unless it be an admirer of Mr.
Flamson&mdash;a clown&mdash;who will, perhaps, shout: &ldquo;I
say he is no gentleman; for who can be a gentleman who keeps no
gig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The indifference exhibited by Lavengro for what is merely
genteel, compared with his solicitude never to infringe the
strict laws of honour, should read a salutary lesson.&nbsp; The
generality of his countrymen are far more careful not to
transgress the customs of what they call gentility, than to
violate the laws of honour or morality.&nbsp; They will shrink
from carrying their own carpet-bag, and from speaking to a person
in seedy raiment, whilst to matters of much higher importance
they are shamelessly indifferent.&nbsp; Not so Lavengro; he will
do anything that he deems convenient, or which strikes his fancy,
provided it does not outrage decency, or is unallied to
profligacy; is not ashamed to speak to a beggar in rags, and will
associate with anybody, provided he can gratify a laudable
curiosity.&nbsp; He has no abstract love for what is low, or what
the world calls low.&nbsp; He sees that many things which the
world looks down upon are valuable, so he prizes much which the
world contemns; he sees that many things which the world admires
are contemptible, so he despises much which the world does not;
but when the world prizes what is really excellent, he does not
contemn it, because the world regards it.&nbsp; If he learns
Irish, which all the world scoffs at, he likewise learns Italian,
which all the world melts at.&nbsp; If he learns Gypsy, the
language <a name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
325</span>of the tattered tent, he likewise learns Greek, the
language of the college hall.&nbsp; If he learns smithery, he
also learns&mdash;ah! what does he learn to set against
smithery?&mdash;the law?&nbsp; No; he does not learn the law,
which, by the way, is not very genteel.&nbsp; Swimming?&nbsp;
Yes, he learns to swim.&nbsp; Swimming, however, is not genteel;
and the world&mdash;at least the genteel part of it&mdash;acts
very wisely in setting its face against it; for to swim you must
be naked, and how would many a genteel person look without his
clothes?&nbsp; Come, he learns horsemanship; a very genteel
accomplishment, which every genteel person would gladly possess,
though not all genteel people do.</p>
<p>Again as to associates: if he holds communion when a boy with
Murtagh, the scarecrow of an Irish academy, he associates in
after life with Francis Ardry, a rich and talented young Irish
gentleman about town.&nbsp; If he accepts an invitation from Mr.
Petulengro to his tent, he has no objection to go home with a
rich genius to dinner; who then will say that he prizes a thing
or a person because they are ungenteel?&nbsp; That he is not
ready to take up with everything that is ungenteel he gives a
proof, when he refuses, though on the brink of starvation, to
become bonnet to the thimble-man, an office, which, though
profitable, is positively ungenteel.&nbsp; Ah! but some
sticker-up for gentility will exclaim: &ldquo;The hero did not
refuse this office from an insurmountable dislike to its
ungentility, but merely from a feeling of principle&rdquo;.&nbsp;
Well! the writer is not fond of argument, and he will admit that
such was the case; he admits that it was a love of principle,
rather than an over-regard for gentility, which prevented the
hero from accepting, when on the brink of starvation, an
ungenteel though lucrative office, an office which, the writer
begs leave to observe, many a person with a great regard for
gentility, and no particular regard for principle, would in a
similar strait have accepted; for when did a mere love for
gentility keep a person from being a dirty scoundrel, when the
alternatives apparently were &ldquo;either be a dirty scoundrel
or starve?&rdquo;&nbsp; One thing, however, is certain, which is,
that Lavengro did not accept the office, which if a love for what
is low had been his ruling passion he certainly would have done;
consequently, he refuses to do one thing which no genteel person
would willingly do, even as he does many things which every
genteel person would gladly do, for example, speaks Italian,
rides on horseback, associates with a fashionable young man,
dines with a rich genius, et cetera.&nbsp; Yet&mdash;and it
cannot be minced&mdash;he and gentility with regard to many
things are at strange divergency; he shrinks from many things <a
name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 326</span>at which
gentility placidly hums a tune, or approvingly simpers, and does
some things at which gentility positively shrinks.&nbsp; He will
not run into debt for clothes or lodgings, which he might do
without any scandal to gentility; he will not receive money from
Francis Ardry, and go to Brighton with the sister of Annette Le
Noir, though there is nothing ungenteel in borrowing money from a
friend, even when you never intend to repay him, and something
poignantly genteel in going to a watering-place with a gay young
Frenchwoman; but he has no objection, after raising twenty pounds
by the sale of that extraordinary work <i>Joseph Sell</i>, to set
off into the country, mend kettles under hedge-rows, and make
pony and donkey shoes in a dingle.&nbsp; Here, perhaps, some
plain, well-meaning person will cry&mdash;and with much apparent
justice&mdash;how can the writer justify him in this act?&nbsp;
What motive, save a love for what is low, could induce him to do
such things?&nbsp; Would the writer have everybody who is in need
of recreation go into the country, mend kettles under hedges, and
make pony shoes in dingles?&nbsp; To such an observation the
writer would answer, that Lavengro had an excellent motive in
doing what he did, but that the writer is not so unreasonable as
to wish everybody to do the same.&nbsp; It is not everybody who
can mend kettles.&nbsp; It is not everybody who is in similar
circumstances to those in which Lavengro was.&nbsp; Lavengro
flies from London and hack authorship, and takes to the roads
from fear of consumption; it is expensive to put up at inns, and
even at public-houses, and Lavengro has not much money; so he
buys a tinker&rsquo;s cart and apparatus, and sets up as tinker,
and subsequently as blacksmith; a person living in a tent, or in
anything else, must do something or go mad; Lavengro had a mind,
as he himself well knew, with some slight tendency to madness,
and had he not employed himself, he must have gone wild; so to
employ himself he drew upon one of his resources, the only one
available at the time.&nbsp; Authorship had nearly killed him, he
was sick of reading, and had besides no books; but he possessed
the rudiments of an art akin to tinkering; he knew something of
smithery, having served a kind of apprenticeship in Ireland to a
fairy smith; so he draws upon his smithery to enable him to
acquire tinkering, and through the help which it affords him,
owing to its connection with tinkering, he speedily acquires that
craft, even as he had speedily acquired Welsh, owing to its
connection with Irish, which language he possessed; and with
tinkering he amuses himself until he lays it aside to resume
smithery.&nbsp; A man who has any innocent resource, has quite as
much right to draw upon it in need, as he has upon <a
name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 327</span>a banker in
whose hands he has placed a sum; Lavengro turns to advantage,
under particular circumstances, a certain resource which he has,
but people who are not so forlorn as Lavengro, and have not
served the same apprenticeship which he had, are not advised to
follow his example.&nbsp; Surely he was better employed in plying
the trades of tinker and smith than in having recourse to vice,
in running after milk-maids, for example.&nbsp; Running after
milk-maids is by no means an ungenteel rural diversion; but let
any one ask some respectable casuist (The Bishop of London for
example), whether Lavengro was not far better employed, when in
the country, at tinkering and smithery than he would have been in
running after all the milk-maids in Cheshire, though tinkering is
in general considered a very ungenteel employment, and smithery
little better, notwithstanding that an Orcadian poet, who wrote
in Norse about eight hundred years ago, reckons the latter among
nine noble arts which he possessed, naming it along with playing
at chess, on the harp, and ravelling runes, or as the original
has it, &ldquo;treading runes&rdquo;&mdash;that is, compressing
them into a small compass by mingling one letter with another,
even as the Turkish caligraphists ravel the Arabic letters, more
especially those who write talismans.</p>
<blockquote><p>Nine arts have I, all noble;<br />
I play at chess so free,<br />
At ravelling runes I&rsquo;m ready,<br />
At books and smithery;<br />
I&rsquo;m skill&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er ice at skimming<br />
On skates, I shoot and row,<br />
And few at harping match me,<br />
Or minstrelsy, I trow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But though Lavengro takes up smithery, which, though the
Orcadian ranks it with chess-playing and harping, is certainly
somewhat of a grimy art, there can be no doubt that, had he been
wealthy and not so forlorn as he was, he would have turned to
many things, honourable, of course, in preference.&nbsp; He has
no objection to ride a fine horse when he has the opportunity: he
has his day-dream of making a fortune of two hundred thousand
pounds by becoming a merchant and doing business after the
Armenian fashion; and there can be no doubt that he would have
been glad to wear fine clothes, provided he had had sufficient
funds to authorise him in wearing them.&nbsp; For the sake of
wandering the country and plying the hammer and tongs, he would
not have refused a commission in the service of that illustrious
monarch George the Fourth, provided he had thought <a
name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 328</span>that he
could live on his pay, and not be forced to run in debt to
tradesmen, without any hope of paying them, for clothes and
luxuries, as many highly genteel officers in that honourable
service were in the habit of doing.&nbsp; For the sake of
tinkering, he would certainly not have refused a secretaryship of
an embassy to Persia, in which he might have turned his
acquaintance with Persian, Arabic, and the Lord only knows what
other languages, to account.&nbsp; He took to tinkering and
smithery, because no better employments were at his
command.&nbsp; No war is waged in the book against rank, wealth,
fine clothes or dignified employments; it is shown, however, that
a person may be a gentleman and a scholar without them.&nbsp;
Rank, wealth, fine clothes and dignified employments, are no
doubt very fine things, but they are merely externals, they do
not make a gentleman, they add external grace and dignity to the
gentleman and scholar, but they make neither; and is it not
better to be a gentleman without them than not a gentleman with
them?&nbsp; Is not Lavengro, when he leaves London on foot with
twenty pounds in his pocket, entitled to more respect than Mr.
Flamson flaming in his coach with a million?&nbsp; And is not
even the honest jockey at Horncastle, who offers a fair price to
Lavengro for his horse, entitled to more than the scoundrel lord,
who attempts to cheat him of one-fourth of its value.</p>
<p>Millions, however, seem to think otherwise, by their servile
adoration of people whom without rank, wealth and fine clothes
they would consider infamous, but whom possessed of rank, wealth
and glittering habiliments they seem to admire all the more for
their profligacy and crimes.&nbsp; Does not a blood-spot, or a
lust-spot, on the clothes of a blooming emperor, give a kind of
zest to the genteel young god?&nbsp; Do not the pride,
superciliousness and selfishness of a certain aristocracy make it
all the more regarded by its worshippers? and do not the clownish
and gutter-blood admirers of Mr. Flamson like him all the more
because they are conscious that he is a knave?&nbsp; If such is
the case&mdash;and alas! is it not the case?&mdash;they cannot be
too frequently told that fine clothes, wealth and titles adorn a
person in proportion as he adorns them; that if worn by the
magnanimous and good they are ornaments indeed, but if by the
vile and profligate they are merely <i>san benitos</i>, and only
serve to make their infamy doubly apparent; and that a person in
seedy raiment and tattered hat, possessed of courage, kindness
and virtue, is entitled to more respect from those to whom his
virtues are manifested than any cruel profligate emperor, selfish
aristocrat, or knavish millionnaire in the world.</p>
<p><a name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 329</span>The
writer has no intention of saying that all in England are
affected with the absurd mania for gentility; nor is such a
statement made in the book; it is shown therein that individuals
of various classes can prize a gentleman, notwithstanding seedy
raiment, dusty shoes or tattered hat&mdash;for example, the young
Irishman, the rich genius, the postillion, and his
employer.&nbsp; Again, when the life of the hero is given to the
world, amidst the howl about its lowness and vulgarity, raised by
the servile crew whom its independence of sentiment has stung,
more than one powerful voice has been heard testifying
approbation of its learning and the purity of its morality.&nbsp;
That there is some salt in England, minds not swayed by mere
externals, he is fully convinced; if he were not, he would spare
himself the trouble of writing; but to the fact that the
generality of his countrymen are basely grovelling before the
shrine of what they are pleased to call gentility, he cannot shut
his eyes.</p>
<p>Oh! what a clever person that Cockney was, who, travelling in
the Aberdeen railroad carriage, after edifying the company with
his remarks on various subjects, gave it as his opinion that
Lieutenant P&mdash; would, in future, be shunned by all
respectable society!&nbsp; And what a simple person that elderly
gentleman was, who, abruptly starting, asked in rather an
authoritative voice, &ldquo;And why should Lieutenant P&mdash; be
shunned by respectable society?&rdquo; and who, after entering
into what was said to be a masterly analysis of the entire
evidence of the case, concluded by stating, &ldquo;that having
been accustomed to all kinds of evidence all his life, he had
never known a case in which the accused had obtained a more
complete and triumphant justification than Lieutenant P&mdash;
had done in the late trial&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Now the Cockney, who is said to have been a very foppish
Cockney, was perfectly right in what he said, and therein
manifested a knowledge of the English mind and character, and
likewise of the modern English language, to which his catechist,
who, it seems, was a distinguished member of the Scottish bar,
could lay no pretensions.&nbsp; The Cockney knew what the Lord of
Session knew not, that the British public is gentility crazy, and
he knew, moreover, that gentility and respectability are
synonymous.&nbsp; No one in England is genteel or respectable
that is &ldquo;looked at,&rdquo; who is the victim of oppression;
he may be pitied for a time, but when did not pity terminate in
contempt?&nbsp; A poor harmless young officer&mdash;but why enter
into the details of the infamous case? they are but too well
known, and if ever cruelty, pride and cowardice, and things much
worse than even cruelty, cowardice and pride were <a
name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 330</span>brought to
light, and, at the same time, countenanced, they were in that
case.&nbsp; What availed the triumphant justification of the poor
victim?&nbsp; There was at first a roar of indignation against
his oppressors, but how long did it last?&nbsp; He had been
turned out of the service, they remained in it with their red
coats and epaulets; he was merely the son of a man who had
rendered good service to his country; they were, for the most
part, highly connected&mdash;they were in the extremest degree
genteel, he quite the reverse; so the nation wavered, considered,
thought the genteel side was the safest after all, and then with
the cry of &ldquo;Oh! there is nothing like gentility,&rdquo;
ratted bodily.&nbsp; Newspaper and public turned against the
victim, scouted him, apologised for the&mdash;what should they be
called?&mdash;who were not only admitted into the most
respectable society, but courted to come, the spots not merely of
wine on their military clothes, giving them a kind of
poignancy.&nbsp; But there is a God in heaven; the British
glories are tarnished&mdash;Providence has never smiled on
British arms since that case&mdash;oh! Balaklava! thy name
interpreted is net of fishes, and well dost thou deserve that
name.&nbsp; How many a scarlet golden fish has of late perished
in the mud amidst thee, cursing the genteel service, and the
genteel leader which brought him to such a doom.</p>
<p>Whether the rage for gentility is most prevalent amongst the
upper, middle or lower classes it is difficult to say; the priest
in the text seems to think that it is exhibited in the most
decided manner in the middle class; it is the writer&rsquo;s
opinion, however, that in no class is it more strongly developed
than in the lower: what they call being well-born goes a great
way amongst them, but the possession of money much farther,
whence Mr. Flamson&rsquo;s influence over them.&nbsp; Their rage
against, and scorn for, any person who by his courage and talents
has advanced himself in life, and still remains poor, are
indescribable; &ldquo;he is no better than ourselves,&rdquo; they
say, &ldquo;why should he be above us?&rdquo;&mdash;for they have
no conception that anybody has a right to ascendency over
themselves except by birth or money.&nbsp; This feeling amongst
the vulgar has been, to a certain extent, the bane of the two
services, naval and military.&nbsp; The writer does not make this
assertion rashly; he observed this feeling at work in the army
when a child, and he has good reason for believing that it was as
strongly at work in the navy at the same time, and is still as
prevalent in both.&nbsp; Why are not brave men raised from the
ranks? is frequently the cry, why are not brave sailors promoted?
the Lord help brave soldiers and sailors who are promoted; they
have less to undergo from the <a name="page331"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 331</span>high airs of their brother officers,
and those are hard enough to endure, than from the insolence of
the men.&nbsp; Soldiers and sailors promoted to command are said
to be in general tyrants; in nine cases out of ten, when they are
tyrants, they have been obliged to have recourse to extreme
severity in order to protect themselves from the insolence and
mutinous spirit of the men,&mdash;&ldquo;He is no better than
ourselves: shoot him, bayonet him, or fling him overboard!&rdquo;
they say of some obnoxious individual raised above them by his
merit.&nbsp; Soldiers and sailors in general, will bear any
amount of tyranny from a lordly sot, or the son of a man who has
&ldquo;plenty of brass&rdquo;&mdash;their own term&mdash;but will
mutiny against the just orders of a skilful and brave officer who
&ldquo;is no better than themselves&rdquo;.&nbsp; There was the
affair of the <i>Bounty</i>, for example: Bligh was one of the
best seamen that ever trod deck, and one of the bravest of men;
proofs of his seamanship he gave by steering, amidst dreadful
weather, a deeply laden boat for nearly four thousand miles over
an almost unknown ocean&mdash;of his bravery, at the fight of
Copenhagen, one of the most desperate ever fought, of which after
Nelson he was the hero: he was, moreover, not an unkind man; but
the crew of the <i>Bounty</i>, mutinied against him, and set him
half naked in an open boat, with certain of his men who remained
faithful to him, and ran away with the ship.&nbsp; Their
principal motive for doing so was an idea, whether true or
groundless the writer cannot say, that Bligh was &ldquo;no better
than themselves&rdquo;; he was certainly neither a lord&rsquo;s
illegitimate, nor possessed of twenty thousand pounds.&nbsp; The
writer knows what he is writing about, having been acquainted in
his early years with an individual who was turned adrift with
Bligh, and who died about the year &rsquo;22, a lieutenant in the
navy, in a provincial town in which the writer was brought
up.&nbsp; The ringleaders in the mutiny were two scoundrels,
Christian and Young, who had great influence with the crew,
because they were genteelly connected.&nbsp; Bligh, after leaving
the <i>Bounty</i>, had considerable difficulty in managing the
men who had shared his fate, because they considered themselves
&ldquo;as good men as he,&rdquo; notwithstanding, that to his
conduct and seamanship they had alone to look, under Heaven, for
salvation from the ghastly perils that surrounded them.&nbsp;
Bligh himself, in his journal, alludes to this feeling.&nbsp;
Once, when he and his companions landed on a desert island, one
of them said, with a mutinous look, that he considered himself
&ldquo;as good a man as he&rdquo;; Bligh, seizing a cutlass,
called upon him to take another and defend himself, whereupon the
man said that Bligh was going to kill him, and made all manner of
concessions; now why did this <a name="page332"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 332</span>fellow consider himself as good a
man as Bligh?&nbsp; Was he as good a seaman? no, nor a tenth part
as good.&nbsp; As brave a man? no, nor a tenth part as brave; and
of these facts he was perfectly well aware, but bravery and
seamanship stood for nothing with him, as they still stand with
thousands of his class; Bligh was not genteel by birth or money,
therefore Bligh was no better than himself.&nbsp; Had Bligh,
before he sailed, got a twenty-thousand pound prize in the
lottery, he would have experienced no insolence from this fellow,
for there would have been no mutiny in the <i>Bounty</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He is our betters,&rdquo; the crew would have said,
&ldquo;and it is our duty to obey him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wonderful power of gentility in England is exemplified in
nothing more than in what it is producing amongst Jews, Gypsies
and Quakers.&nbsp; It is breaking up their venerable
communities.&nbsp; All the better, some one will say.&nbsp; Alas!
alas!&nbsp; It is making the wealthy Jews forsake the synagogue
for the opera-house, or the gentility chapel, in which a disciple
of Mr. Platitude, in a white surplice, preaches a sermon at
noon-day from a desk, on each side of which is a flaming
taper.&nbsp; It is making them abandon their ancient literature,
their <i>Mischna</i>, their <i>Gemara</i>, their <i>Zohar</i>,
for gentility novels, <i>The Young Duke</i>, the most
unexceptionably genteel book ever written, being the principal
favourite.&nbsp; It makes the young Jew ashamed of the young
Jewess, it makes her ashamed of the young Jew.&nbsp; The young
Jew marries an opera dancer, or if the dancer will not have him,
as is frequently the case, the cast-off Miss of the honourable
Spencer So-and-so.&nbsp; It makes the young Jewess accept the
honourable offer of a cashiered lieutenant of the Bengal Native
Infantry; or, if such a person does not come forward, the
dishonourable offer of a cornet of a regiment of crack
hussars.&nbsp; It makes poor Jews, male and female, forsake the
synagogue for the sixpenny theatre or penny hop; the Jew to take
up with an Irish female of loose character, and the Jewess with a
musician of the Guards, or the Tipperary servant of Captain
Mulligan.&nbsp; With respect to the gypsies, it is making the
women what they never were before&mdash;harlots; and the men what
they never were before&mdash;careless fathers and husbands.&nbsp;
It has made the daughter of Ursula, the chaste, take up with the
base drummer of a wild-beast show.&nbsp; It makes Gorgiko Brown,
the gypsy man, leave his tent and his old wife, of an evening,
and thrust himself into society which could well dispense with
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said Mr. Petulengro the other
day to the Romany Rye, after telling him many things connected
with the decadence of gypsyism, &ldquo;there is one Gorgiko
Brown, who, with a face as black as a tea-kettle, wishes <a
name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 333</span>to be
mistaken for a Christian tradesman; he goes into the parlour of a
third-rate inn of an evening, calls for rum and water, and
attempts to enter into conversation with the company about
politics and business; the company flout him or give him the cold
shoulder, or perhaps complain to the landlord, who comes and asks
him what business he has in the parlour, telling him if he wants
to drink to go into the tap-room, and perhaps collars him and
kicks him out, provided he refuses to move.&rdquo;&nbsp; With
respect to the Quakers, it makes the young people like the young
Jews, crazy after gentility diversions, worship, marriages or
connections, and makes old Pease do what it makes Gorgiko Brown
do, thrust himself into society which could well dispense with
him, and out of which he is not kicked, because unlike the gypsy
he is not poor.&nbsp; The writer would say much more on these
points, but want of room prevents him; he must therefore request
the reader to have patience until he can lay before the world a
pamphlet, which he has been long meditating, to be entitled
&ldquo;Remarks on the strikingly similar Effects which a Love for
Gentility has produced, and is producing, amongst Jews, Gypsies
and Quakers&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The priest in the book has much to say on the subject of this
gentility-nonsense; no person can possibly despise it more
thoroughly than that very remarkable individual seems to do, yet
he hails its prevalence with pleasure, knowing the benefits which
will result from it to the Church of which he is the sneering
slave.&nbsp; &ldquo;The English are mad after gentility,&rdquo;
says he; &ldquo;well, all the better for us; their religion for a
long time past has been a plain and simple one, and consequently
by no means genteel; they&rsquo;ll quit it for ours, which is the
perfection of what they admire; with which Templars, Hospitalers,
mitred abbots, Gothic abbeys, long-drawn aisles, golden censers,
incense, et cetera, are connected; nothing, or next to nothing,
of Christ, it is true, but weighed in the balance against
gentility, where will Christianity be? why, kicking against the
beam&mdash;ho! ho!&rdquo;&nbsp; And in connection with the
gentility-nonsense, he expatiates largely, and with much
contempt, on a species of literature by which the interests of
his Church in England have been very much advanced&mdash;all
genuine priests have a thorough contempt for everything which
tends to advance the interests of their Church&mdash;this
literature is made up of pseudo Jacobitism, Charlie o&rsquo;er
the waterism, or nonsense about Charlie o&rsquo;er the
water.&nbsp; And the writer will now take the liberty of saying a
few words about it on his own account.</p>
<h3><a name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
334</span>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ON SCOTCH GENTILITY NONSENSE.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> the literature just alluded to
Scott was the inventor.&nbsp; It is founded on the fortunes and
misfortunes of the Stuart family, of which Scott was the zealous
defender and apologist, doing all that in his power lay to
represent the members of it as noble, chivalrous, high-minded,
unfortunate princes; though, perhaps, of all the royal families
that ever existed upon earth, this family was the worst.&nbsp; It
was unfortunate enough, it is true; but it owed its misfortunes
entirely to its crimes, viciousness, bad faith, and
cowardice.&nbsp; Nothing will be said of it here until it made
its appearance in England to occupy the English throne.</p>
<p>The first of the family which we have to do with, James, was a
dirty, cowardly miscreant, of whom the less said the
better.&nbsp; His son, Charles the First, was a
tyrant&mdash;exceedingly cruel and revengeful, but weak and
dastardly; he caused a poor fellow to be hanged in London, who
was not his subject, because he had heard that the unfortunate
creature had once bit his own glove at Cadiz, in Spain, at the
mention of his name; and he permitted his own bull-dog,
Strafford, to be executed by his own enemies, though the only
crime of Strafford was, that he had barked furiously at those
enemies, and had worried two or three of them, when Charles
shouted, &ldquo;Fetch &rsquo;em&rdquo;.&nbsp; He was a bitter,
but yet a despicable enemy, and the coldest and most worthless of
friends; for though he always hoped to be able, some time or
other, to hang his enemies, he was always ready to curry favour
with them, more especially if he could do so at the expense of
his friends.&nbsp; He was the haughtiest, yet meanest of
mankind.&nbsp; He once caned a young nobleman for appearing
before him in the drawing-room not dressed exactly according to
the court etiquette; yet he condescended to flatter and
compliment him who, from principle, was his bitterest enemy,
namely Harrison, when the republican colonel was conducting him
as a prisoner to London.&nbsp; His bad faith was notorious; it
was from abhorrence of the first public instance which he gave of
his bad faith, his breaking his word to the Infanta of Spain,
that the poor Hiberno-Spaniard bit his glove at Cadiz; and it was
his notorious bad faith which eventually cost <a
name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 335</span>him his
head; for the Republicans would gladly have spared him, provided
they could put the slightest confidence in any promise, however
solemn, which he might have made to them.&nbsp; Of them, it would
be difficult to say whether they most hated or despised
him.&nbsp; Religion he had none.&nbsp; One day he favoured
Popery; the next, on hearing certain clamours of the people, he
sent his wife&rsquo;s domestics back packing to France, because
they were Papists.&nbsp; Papists, however, should make him a
saint, for he was certainly the cause of the taking of
Rochelle.</p>
<p>His son, Charles the Second, though he passed his youth in the
school of adversity, learned no other lesson from it than the
following one&mdash;take care of yourself, and never do an
action, either good or bad, which is likely to bring you into any
great difficulty; and this maxim he acted up to as soon as he
came to the throne.&nbsp; He was a Papist, but took especial care
not to acknowledge his religion, at which he frequently scoffed,
till just before his last gasp, when he knew that he could lose
nothing, and hoped to gain everything by it.&nbsp; He was always
in want of money, but took care not to tax the country beyond all
endurable bounds; preferring to such a bold and dangerous course,
to become the secret pensioner of Louis, to whom, in return for
his gold, he sacrificed the honour and interests of
Britain.&nbsp; He was too lazy and sensual to delight in playing
the part of a tyrant himself; but he never checked tyranny in
others save in one instance.&nbsp; He permitted beastly butchers
to commit unmentionable horrors on the feeble, unarmed and
disunited Covenanters of Scotland, but checked them when they
would fain have endeavoured to play the same game on the numerous
united, dogged and warlike Independents of England.&nbsp; To show
his filial piety, he bade the hangman dishonour the corpses of
some of his father&rsquo;s judges, before whom, when alive, he
ran like a screaming hare; but permitted those who had lost their
all in supporting his father&rsquo;s cause, to pine in misery and
want.&nbsp; He would give to a painted harlot a thousand pounds
for a loathsome embrace, and to a player or buffoon a hundred for
a trumpery pun, but would refuse a penny to the widow or orphan
of an old Royalist soldier.&nbsp; He was the personification of
selfishness; and as he loved and cared for no one, so did no one
love or care for him.&nbsp; So little had he gained the respect
or affection of those who surrounded him, that after his body had
undergone an after-death examination, parts of it were thrown
down the sinks of the palace, to become eventually the prey of
the swine and ducks of Westminster.</p>
<p>His brother, who succeeded him James the Second, was a <a
name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 336</span>Papist, but
sufficiently honest to acknowledge his Popery, but upon the
whole, he was a poor creature; though a tyrant, he was cowardly;
had he not been a coward he would never have lost his
throne.&nbsp; There were plenty of lovers of tyranny in England
who would have stood by him, provided he would have stood by
them, and would, though not Papists, have encouraged him in his
attempt to bring back England beneath the sway of Rome, and
perhaps would eventually have become Papists themselves; but the
nation raising a cry against him, and his son-in-law, the Prince
of Orange, invading the country, he forsook his friends, of whom
he had a host, but for whom he cared little&mdash;left his
throne, for which he cared a great deal&mdash;and Popery in
England, for which he cared yet more, to their fate, and escaped
to France, from whence, after taking a little heart, he repaired
to Ireland, where he was speedily joined by a gallant army of
Papists whom he basely abandoned at the Boyne, running away in a
most lamentable condition, at the time when by showing a little
courage he might have enabled them to conquer.&nbsp; This worthy,
in his last will, bequeathed his heart to England, his right arm
to Scotland, and his bowels to Ireland.&nbsp; What the English
and Scotch said to their respective bequests is not known, but it
is certain that an old Irish priest, supposed to have been a
great grand-uncle of the present Reverend Father Murtagh, on
hearing of the bequest to Ireland, fell into a great passion, and
having been brought up at &ldquo;Paris and Salamanca,&rdquo;
expressed his indignation in the following strain:
&ldquo;<i>Malditas sean tus tripas</i>! <i>teniamos bastante del
olor de tus tripas al tiempo de tu huida de la batalla del
Boyne</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His son, generally called the Old Pretender, though born in
England, was carried in his infancy to France, where he was
brought up in the strictest principles of Popery, which
principles, however, did not prevent him becoming (when did they
ever prevent any one?) a worthless and profligate scoundrel;
there are some doubts as to the reality of his being a son of
James, which doubts are probably unfounded, the grand proof of
his legitimacy being the thorough baseness of his
character.&nbsp; It was said of his father that he could speak
well, and it may be said of him that he could write well, the
only thing he could do which was worth doing, always supposing
that there is any merit in being able to write.&nbsp; He was of a
mean appearance, and, like his father, pusillanimous to a
degree.&nbsp; The meaness of his appearance disgusted, and his
pusillanimity discouraged, the Scotch when he made his appearance
amongst them in the year 1715, some time after the standard of
rebellion had been hoisted by Mar.&nbsp; He <a
name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 337</span>only stayed
a short time in Scotland, and then, seized with panic, retreated
to France, leaving his friends to shift for themselves as they
best could.&nbsp; He died a pensioner of the Pope.</p>
<p>The son of this man, Charles Edward, of whom so much in latter
years has been said and written, was a worthless, ignorant youth,
and a profligate and illiterate old man.&nbsp; When young, the
best that can be said of him is, that he had occasionally springs
of courage, invariably at the wrong time and place, which merely
served to lead his friends into inextricable difficulties.&nbsp;
When old, he was loathsome and contemptible to both friend and
foe.&nbsp; His wife loathed him, and for the most terrible of
reasons; she did not pollute his couch, for to do that was
impossible&mdash;he had made it so vile; but she betrayed it,
inviting to it not only Alfieri the Filthy, but the coarsest
grooms.&nbsp; Doctor King, the warmest and almost last adherent
of his family, said that there was not a vice or crime of which
he was not guilty; as for his foes, they scorned to harm him even
when in their power.&nbsp; In the year 1745 he came down from the
Highlands of Scotland, which had long been a focus of
rebellion.&nbsp; He was attended by certain clans of the
Highlands, desperadoes used to free-bootery from their infancy,
and, consequently, to the use of arms, and possessed of a certain
species of discipline; with these he defeated at Prestonpans a
body of men called soldiers, but who were in reality peasants and
artisans, levied about a month before, without discipline or
confidence in each other, and who were miserably massacred by the
Highland army; he subsequently invaded England, nearly destitute
of regular soldiers, and penetrated as far as Derby, from which
place he retreated on learning that regular forces which had been
hastily recalled from Flanders were coming against him, with the
Duke of Cumberland at their head; he was pursued, and his rear
guard overtaken and defeated by the dragoons of the duke at
Clifton, from which place the rebels retreated in great confusion
across the Eden into Scotland, where they commenced dancing
Highland reels and strathspeys on the bank of the river, for joy
at their escape, whilst a number of wretched girls, paramours of
some of them, were perishing in the waters of the swollen river
in an attempt to follow them; they themselves passed over by
eighties and by hundreds, arm in arm, for mutual safety, without
the loss of a man, but they left the poor paramours to shift for
themselves, nor did any of these canny people after passing the
stream dash back to rescue a single female life&mdash;no, they
were too well employed upon the bank in dancing strathspeys to
the tune of &ldquo;Charlie o&rsquo;er the water&rdquo;.&nbsp; It
was, indeed, Charlie o&rsquo;er <a name="page338"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 338</span>the water, and canny Highlanders
o&rsquo;er the water, but where were the poor prostitutes
meantime?&nbsp; <i>In the water</i>.</p>
<p>The Jacobite farce, or tragedy, was speedily brought to a
close by the battle of Culloden; there did Charlie wish himself
back again o&rsquo;er the water, exhibiting the most unmistakable
signs of pusillanimity; there were the clans cut to pieces, at
least those who could be brought to the charge, and there fell
Giles Mac Bean, or as he was called in Gaelic, Giliosa Mac
Beathan, a kind of giant, six feet four inches and a quarter
high, &ldquo;than whom,&rdquo; as his wife said in a
<i>coronach</i> she made upon him, &ldquo;no man who stood at
Cuiloitr was taller&rdquo;&mdash;Giles Mac Bean the Major of the
clan Cattan&mdash;a great drinker&mdash;a great fisher&mdash;a
great shooter, and the champion of the Highland host.</p>
<p>The last of the Stuarts was a cardinal.</p>
<p>Such were the Stuarts, such their miserable history.&nbsp;
They were dead and buried in every sense of the word until Scott
resuscitated them&mdash;how? by the power of fine writing, and by
calling to his aid that strange divinity, gentility.&nbsp; He
wrote splendid novels about the Stuarts, in which he represents
them as unlike what they really were, as the graceful and
beautiful papillon is unlike the hideous and filthy worm.&nbsp;
In a word, he made them genteel, and that was enough to give them
paramount sway over the minds of the British people.&nbsp; The
public became Stuart-mad, and everybody, especially the women,
said, &ldquo;What a pity it was that we hadn&rsquo;t a Stuart to
govern&rdquo;.&nbsp; All parties, Whig, Tory or Radical, became
Jacobite at heart, and admirers of absolute power.&nbsp; The
Whigs talked about the liberty of the subject, and the Radicals
about the rights of man still, but neither party cared a straw
for what it talked about, and mentally swore that, as soon as by
means of such stuff they could get places, and fill their
pockets, they would be as Jacobite as the Jacobs
themselves.&nbsp; As for the Tories, no great change in them was
necessary; everything favouring absolutism and slavery being
congenial to them.&nbsp; So the whole nation, that is, the
reading part of the nation, with some exceptions, for thank God
there has always been some salt in England, went over the water
to Charlie.&nbsp; But going over to Charlie was not enough, they
must, or at least a considerable part of them, go over to Rome
too, or have a hankering to do so.&nbsp; As the priest
sarcastically observes in the text, &ldquo;As all the Jacobs were
Papists, so the good folks who through Scott&rsquo;s novels
admire the Jacobs must be Papists too&rdquo;.&nbsp; An idea got
about that the religion of such genteel people as the Stuarts
must be the climax of gentility, and that idea was quite
sufficient.&nbsp; Only let a thing, <a name="page339"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 339</span>whether temporal or spiritual, be
considered genteel in England, and if it be not followed it is
strange indeed; so Scott&rsquo;s writings not only made the
greater part of the nation Jacobite, but Popish.</p>
<p>Here some people will exclaim&mdash;whose opinions remain
sound and uncontaminated&mdash;what you say is perhaps true with
respect to the Jacobite nonsense at present so prevalent being
derived from Scott&rsquo;s novels, but the Popish nonsense, which
people of the genteeler classes are so fond of, is derived from
Oxford.&nbsp; We sent our sons to Oxford nice honest lads,
educated in the principles of the Church of England, and at the
end of the first term they came home puppies, talking Popish
nonsense, which they had learned from the pedants to whose care
we had entrusted them; ay, not only Popery but Jacobitism, which
they hardly carried with them from home, for we never heard them
talking Jacobitism before they had been at Oxford; but now their
conversation is a farrago of Popish and Jacobite
stuff&mdash;&ldquo;Complines and Claverse&rdquo;.&nbsp; Now, what
these honest folks say is, to a certain extent, founded on fact;
the Popery which has overflowed the land during the last fourteen
or fifteen years, has come immediately from Oxford, and likewise
some of the Jacobitism, Popish and Jacobite nonsense, and little
or nothing else, having been taught at Oxford for about that
number of years.&nbsp; But whence did the pedants get the Popish
nonsense with which they have corrupted youth?&nbsp; Why, from
the same quarter from which they got the Jacobite nonsense with
which they have inoculated those lads who were not inoculated
with it before&mdash;Scott&rsquo;s novels.&nbsp; Jacobitism and
Laudism, a kind of half Popery, had at one time been very
prevalent at Oxford, but both had been long consigned to oblivion
there, and people at Oxford cared as little about Laud as they
did about the Pretender.&nbsp; Both were dead and buried there,
as everywhere else, till Scott called them out of their graves
when the pedants of Oxford hailed both&mdash;ay, and the Pope,
too, as soon as Scott had made the old fellow fascinating,
through particular novels, more especially the <i>Monastery</i>
and <i>Abbot</i>.&nbsp; Then the quiet, respectable, honourable
Church of England would no longer do for the pedants of Oxford;
they must belong to a more genteel Church&mdash;they were ashamed
at first to be downright Romans&mdash;so they would be
Lauds.&nbsp; The pale-looking, but exceedingly genteel non-juring
clergyman in <i>Waverley</i> was a Laud; but they soon became
tired of being Lauds, for Laud&rsquo;s Church, gew-gawish and
idolatrous as it was, was not sufficiently tinselly and
idolatrous for them, so they must be Popes, but in a sneaking
way, still calling themselves Church of England men, in order to
<a name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 340</span>batten
on the bounty of the Church which they were betraying, and
likewise have opportunities of corrupting such lads as might
still resort to Oxford with principles uncontaminated.</p>
<p>So the respectable people, whose opinions are still sound,
are, to a certain extent, right when they say that the tide of
Popery, which has flowed over the land, has come from
Oxford.&nbsp; It did come immediately from Oxford, but how did it
get to Oxford?&nbsp; Why, from Scott&rsquo;s novels.&nbsp; Oh!
that sermon which was the first manifestation of Oxford feeling,
preached at Oxford some time in the year &rsquo;38 by a divine of
a weak and confused intellect, in which Popery was mixed up with
Jacobitism!&nbsp; The present writer remembers perfectly well, on
reading some extracts from it at the time in a newspaper, on the
top of a coach, exclaiming&mdash;&ldquo;Why, the simpleton has
been pilfering from Walter Scott&rsquo;s novels!&rdquo;</p>
<p>O Oxford pedants!&nbsp; Oxford pedants! ye whose politics and
religion are both derived from Scott&rsquo;s novels! what a pity
it is that some lad of honest parents, whose mind ye are
endeavouring to stultify with your nonsense about
&ldquo;Complines and Claverse,&rdquo; has not the spirit to start
up and cry, &ldquo;Confound your gibberish!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have
none of it.&nbsp; Hurrah for the Church, and the principles of
<i>my father</i>!&rdquo;</p>

341</span>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">SAME SUBJECT CONTINUED.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> what could have induced Scott
to write novels tending to make people Papists and Jacobites, and
in love with arbitrary power?&nbsp; Did he think that
Christianity was a gaudy mummery?&nbsp; He did not, he could not,
for he had read the Bible; yet was he fond of gaudy mummeries,
fond of talking about them.&nbsp; Did he believe that the Stuarts
were a good family, and fit to govern a country like
Britain?&nbsp; He knew that they were a vicious, worthless crew,
and that Britain was a degraded country as long as they swayed
the sceptre; but for those facts he cared nothing, they governed
in a way which he liked, for he had an abstract love of
despotism, and an abhorrence of everything savouring of freedom
and the rights of man in general.&nbsp; His favourite political
picture was a joking, profligate, careless king, nominally
absolute&mdash;the heads of great houses paying court to, but in
reality governing, that king, whilst revelling with him on the
plunder of a nation, and a set of crouching, grovelling vassals
(the literal meaning of vassal is a wretch), who, after allowing
themselves to be horsewhipped, would take a bone if flung to
them, and be grateful; so that in love with mummery, though he
knew what Christianity was, no wonder he admired such a Church as
that of Rome, and that which Laud set up; and by nature formed to
be the holder of the candle to ancient worm-eaten and profligate
families, no wonder that all his sympathies were with the Stuarts
and their dissipated insolent party, and all his hatred directed
against those who endeavoured to check them in their proceedings,
and to raise the generality of mankind something above a state of
vassalage, that is, wretchedness.&nbsp; Those who were born
great, were, if he could have had his will, always to remain
great, however worthless their characters.&nbsp; Those who were
born low, were always to remain so, however great their talents;
though, if that rule were carried out, where would he have been
himself?</p>
<p>In the book which he called the <i>History of Napoleon
Bonaparte</i>, in which he plays the sycophant to all the
legitimate crowned heads in Europe, whatever their crimes, vices
or miserable imbecilities, he, in his abhorrence of everything
low which by its own vigour makes itself illustrious, calls Murat
of the sabre the <a name="page342"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
342</span>son of a pastry-cook, of a Marseilleise
pastry-cook.&nbsp; It is a pity that people who give themselves
hoity-toity airs&mdash;and the Scotch in general are wonderfully
addicted to giving themselves hoity-toity airs, and checking
people better than themselves with their birth <a
name="citation342"></a><a href="#footnote342"
class="citation">[342]</a> and their country&mdash;it is a great
pity that such people do not look at home&mdash;son of a
pastry-cook, of a Marseilleise pastry-cook!&nbsp; Well, and what
was Scott himself?&nbsp; Why, son of a pettifogger, of an
Edinburgh pettifogger.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, but Scott was descended
from the old cow-stealers of Buccleuch, and
therefore&mdash;&rdquo; descended from old cow-stealers, was
he?&nbsp; Well, had he had nothing to boast of beyond such a
pedigree, he would have lived and died the son of a pettifogger,
and been forgotten, and deservedly so; but he possessed talents,
and by his talents rose like Murat, and like him will be
remembered for his talents alone, and deservedly so.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, but Murat was still the son of a pastry-cook, and
though he was certainly good at the sabre, and cut his way to a
throne, still&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Lord! what fools there are in
the world; but as no one can be thought anything of in this world
without a pedigree, the writer will now give a pedigree for
Murat, of a very different character from the cow-stealing one of
Scott, but such a one as the proudest he might not disdain to
claim.&nbsp; Scott was descended from the old cow-stealers of
Buccleuch&mdash;was he?&nbsp; Good! and Murat was descended from
the old Moors of Spain, from the Abencerages (sons of the saddle)
of Granada.&nbsp; The name Murat is Arabic, and is the same as
Murad (<i>Le D&eacute;sir&eacute;</i>, or the wished-for
one).&nbsp; Scott in his genteel <i>Life of Bonaparte</i>, says
that &ldquo;when Murat was in Egypt, the similarity between the
name of the celebrated Mameluke Mourad and that of
Bonaparte&rsquo;s <i>Meilleur Sabreur</i> was remarked, and
became the subject of jest amongst the comrades of the gallant
Frenchman&rdquo;.&nbsp; But the writer of the novel of Bonaparte
did not know that the names were one and the same.&nbsp; Now
which was the best pedigree, that of the son of the pastry-cook,
or that of the son of the pettifogger?&nbsp; Which was the best
blood?&nbsp; Let us observe the workings of the two bloods.&nbsp;
He who had the blood of the &ldquo;sons of the saddle&rdquo; in
him, became the wonderful cavalier of the most wonderful host
that ever went forth to conquest, won for himself a crown <a
name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 343</span>and died
the death of a soldier, leaving behind him a son, only inferior
to himself in strength, in prowess, and in horsemanship.&nbsp;
The descendant of the cow-stealer became a poet, a novel writer,
the panegyrist of great folk and genteel people; became insolvent
because, though an author, he deemed it ungenteel to be mixed up
with the business part of authorship; died paralytic and
broken-hearted because he could no longer give entertainments to
great folks; leaving behind him, amongst other children, who were
never heard of, a son, who, through his father&rsquo;s interest,
had become lieutenant-colonel in a genteel cavalry
regiment.&nbsp; A son who was ashamed of his father because his
father was an author; a son who&mdash;paugh&mdash;why ask which
was the best blood?</p>
<p>So, owing to his rage for gentility, Scott must needs become
the apologist of the Stuarts and their party; but God made this
man pay dearly for taking the part of the wicked against the
good; for lauding up to the skies the miscreants and robbers, and
calumniating the noble spirits of Britain, the salt of England,
and his own country.&nbsp; As God had driven the Stuarts from
their throne, and their followers from their estates, making them
vagabonds and beggars on the face of the earth, taking from them
all they cared for, so did that same God, who knows perfectly
well how and where to strike, deprive the apologist of that
wretched crew of all that rendered life pleasant in his eyes, the
lack of which paralysed him in body and mind, rendered him
pitiable to others, loathsome to himself,&mdash;so much so, that
he once said, &ldquo;Where is the beggar who would change places
with me, notwithstanding all my fame?&rdquo;&nbsp; Ah! God knows
perfectly well how to strike.&nbsp; He permitted him to retain
all his literary fame to the very last&mdash;his literary fame
for which he cared nothing; but what became of the sweetness of
life, his fine house, his grand company, and his
entertainments?&nbsp; The grand house ceased to be his; he was
only permitted to live in it on sufferance, and whatever grandeur
it might still retain, it soon became as desolate a looking house
as any misanthrope could wish to see&mdash;where were the grand
entertainments and the grand company? there are no grand
entertainments where there is no money; no lords and ladies where
there are no entertainments&mdash;and there lay the poor lodger
in the desolate house, groaning on a bed no longer his, smitten
by the hand of God in the part where he was most
vulnerable.&nbsp; Of what use telling such a man to take comfort,
for he had written the <i>Minstrel</i> and <i>Rob
Roy</i>,&mdash;telling him to think of his literary fame?&nbsp;
Literary fame, indeed! he wanted back his lost
gentility.&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a

</blockquote>
<p>He dies, his children die too, and then comes the crowning
judgment of God on what remains of his race and the house which
he had built.&nbsp; He was not a Papist himself, nor did he wish
any one belonging to him to be Popish, for he had read enough of
the Bible to know that no one can be saved through Popery, yet
had he a sneaking affection for it, and would at times in an
underhand manner, give it a good word both in writing and
discourse, because it was a gaudy kind of worship, and ignorance
and vassalage prevailed so long as it flourished&mdash;but he
certainly did not wish any of his people to become Papists, nor
the house which he had built to become a Popish house, though the
very name he gave it savoured of Popery; but Popery becomes
fashionable through his novels and poems&mdash;the only one that
remains of his race, a female grandchild, marries a person who,
following the fashion, becomes a Papist, and makes her a Papist
too.&nbsp; Money abounds with the husband, who buys the house,
and then the house becomes the rankest Popish house in
Britain.&nbsp; A superstitious person might almost imagine that
one of the old Scottish Covenanters, whilst the grand house was
being built from the profits resulting from the sale of writings
favouring Popery and persecution, and calumniatory of
Scotland&rsquo;s saints and martyrs, had risen from the grave,
and banned Scott, his race, and his house, by reading a certain
Psalm.</p>
<p>In saying what he has said about Scott, the author has not
been influenced by any feeling of malice or ill-will, but simply
by a regard for truth, and a desire to point out to his
countrymen the harm which has resulted from the perusal of his
works; he is not one of those who would depreciate the talents of
Scott&mdash;he admires his talents, both as a prose writer and a
poet; as a poet especially he admires him, and believes him to
have been by far the greatest, with perhaps the exception of
Mickiewicz, who only wrote for unfortunate Poland, that Europe
has given birth to during the last hundred years.&nbsp; As a
prose writer he admires him less, it is true, but his admiration
for him in that capacity is very high, and he only laments that
he prostituted his talents to the cause of the Stuarts and
gentility.&nbsp; What book of fiction of the present century can
you read twice, with the exception of <i>Waverley</i> and <i>Rob
Roy</i>?&nbsp; There is <i>Pelham</i> it is true, which the
writer of these lines has seen a Jewess reading in the steppe of
Debreczin, and which a young Prussian Baron, a great traveller,
whom he met at Constantinople in &rsquo;44 told him he always
carried <a name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
345</span>in his valise.&nbsp; And, in conclusion, he will say,
in order to show the opinion which he entertains of the power of
Scott as a writer, that he did for the spectre of the wretched
Pretender what all the kings of Europe could not do for his
body&mdash;placed it on the throne of these realms; and for
Popery, what Popes and Cardinals strove in vain to do for three
centuries&mdash;brought back its mummeries and nonsense into the
temples of the British Isles.</p>
<p>Scott during his lifetime had a crowd of imitators, who,
whether they wrote history so called&mdash;poetry so
called&mdash;or novels&mdash;nobody would call a book a novel if
he could call it anything else&mdash;wrote Charlie o&rsquo;er the
water nonsense; and now that he has been dead nearly a quarter of
a century, there are others daily springing up who are striving
to imitate Scott in his Charlie o&rsquo;er the water
nonsense&mdash;for nonsense it is, even when flowing from his
pen.&nbsp; They, too, must write Jacobite histories, Jacobite
songs, and Jacobite novels, and much the same figure as the
scoundrel menials in the comedy cut when personating their
masters, and retailing their masters&rsquo; conversation, do they
cut as Walter Scotts.&nbsp; In their histories, they too talk
about the Prince and Glenfinnan, and the pibroch; and in their
songs about &ldquo;Claverse&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bonny
Dundee&rdquo;.&nbsp; But though they may be Scots, they are not
Walter Scotts.&nbsp; But it is perhaps chiefly in the novel that
you see the veritable hog in armour; the time of the novel is of
course the &rsquo;15 or &rsquo;45; the hero a Jacobite, and
connected with one or other of the enterprises of those periods;
and the author, to show how unprejudiced he is, and what
<i>original</i> views he takes of subjects, must needs speak up
for Popery, whenever he has occasion to mention it; though with
all his originality, when he brings his hero and the vagabonds
with which he is concerned before a barricaded house, belonging
to the Whigs, he can make them get into it by no other method
than that which Scott makes his rioters employ to get into the
Tolbooth, <i>burning down</i> the door.</p>
<p>To express the more than utter foolishness of this latter
Charlie o&rsquo;er the water nonsense, whether in rhyme or prose,
there is but one word, and that word a Scotch word.&nbsp; Scotch,
the sorriest of jargons, compared with which even Roth-Welsch is
dignified and expressive, has yet one word to express what would
be inexpressible by any word or combination of words in any
language, or in any other jargon in the world; and very properly;
for as the nonsense is properly Scotch, so should the word be
Scotch which expresses it&mdash;that word is
&ldquo;fushionless,&rdquo; pronounced <i>fooshionless</i>; and
when the writer has called the nonsense fooshionless&mdash;and he
does call it fooshionless&mdash;he has nothing more to say, but
leaves the nonsense to its fate.</p>
<h3><a name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
346</span>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ON CANTING NONSENSE.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> writer now wishes to say
something on the subject of canting nonsense, of which there is a
great deal in England.&nbsp; There are various cants in England,
amongst which is the religious cant.&nbsp; He is not going to
discuss the subject of religious cant: lest, however, he should
be misunderstood, he begs leave to repeat that he is a sincere
member of the old-fashioned Church of England, in which he
believes there is more religion, and consequently less cant, than
in any other Church in the world; nor is he going to discuss many
other cants; he shall content himself with saying something about
two&mdash;the temperance cant and the unmanly cant.&nbsp;
Temperance canters say that, &ldquo;it is unlawful to drink a
glass of ale&rdquo;.&nbsp; Unmanly canters say that &ldquo;it is
unlawful to use one&rsquo;s fists&rdquo;.&nbsp; The writer begs
leave to tell both these species of canters that they do not
speak the words of truth.</p>
<p>It is very lawful to take a cup of ale, or wine, for the
purpose of cheering or invigorating yourself when you are faint
and down-hearted; and likewise to give a cup of ale or wine to
others when they are in a similar condition.&nbsp; The Holy
Scripture sayeth nothing to the contrary, but rather encourageth
people in so doing by the text, &ldquo;Wine maketh glad the heart
of man&rdquo;.&nbsp; But it is not lawful to intoxicate yourself
with frequent cups of ale or wine, nor to make others
intoxicated, nor does the Holy Scripture say that it is.&nbsp;
The Holy Scripture no more says that it is lawful to intoxicate
yourself or others, than it says that it is unlawful to take a
cup of ale or wine yourself, or to give one to others.&nbsp; Noah
is not commended in the Scripture for making himself drunken on
the wine he brewed.&nbsp; Nor is it said that the Saviour, when
He supplied the guests with first-rate wine at the marriage
feast, told them to make themselves drunk upon it.&nbsp; He is
said to have supplied them with first-rate wine, but He doubtless
left the quantity which each should drink to each party&rsquo;s
reason and discretion.&nbsp; When you set a good dinner before
your guests, you do not expect that they should gorge themselves
with the victuals you set before them.&nbsp; Wine may be abused,
and so may a leg of mutton.</p>
<p><a name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
347</span>Second.&nbsp; It is lawful for any one to use his fists
in his own defence, or in the defence of others, provided they
can&rsquo;t help themselves; but it is not lawful to use them for
purposes of tyranny or brutality.&nbsp; If you are attacked by a
ruffian, as the elderly individual in <i>Lavengro</i> is in the
inn yard, it is quite lawful, if you can, to give him as good a
thrashing as the elderly individual gave the brutal coachman; and
if you see a helpless woman&mdash;perhaps your own
sister&mdash;set upon by a drunken lord, a drunken coachman, or a
drunken coalheaver, or a brute of any description, either drunk
or sober, it is not only lawful, but laudable to give them, if
you can, a good drubbing; but it is not lawful because you have a
strong pair of fists, and know how to use them, to go swaggering
through a fair, jostling against unoffending individuals; should
you do so, you would be served quite right if you were to get a
drubbing, more particularly if you were served out by some one
less strong, but more skilful than yourself&mdash;even as the
coachman was served out by a pupil of the immortal
Broughton&mdash;sixty years old, it is true, but possessed of
Broughton&rsquo;s guard and chop.&nbsp; Moses is not blamed in
the Scripture for taking part with the oppressed, and killing an
Egyptian persecutor.&nbsp; We are not told how Moses killed the
Egyptian; but it is quite as creditable to Moses to suppose that
he killed the Egyptian by giving him a buffet under the left ear,
as by stabbing him with a knife.&nbsp; It is true that the
Saviour in the New Testament tells His disciples to turn the left
cheek to be smitten, after they had received a blow on the right;
but He was speaking to people divinely inspired, or whom He
intended divinely to inspire&mdash;people selected by God for a
particular purpose.&nbsp; He likewise tells these people to part
with various articles of raiment when asked for them, and to go
a-travelling without money, and take no thought of the
morrow.&nbsp; Are those exhortations carried out by very good
people in the present day?&nbsp; Do Quakers, when smitten on the
right cheek, turn the left to the smiter?&nbsp; When asked for
their coat, do they say, &ldquo;Friend, take my shirt
also?&rdquo;&nbsp; Has the Dean of Salisbury no purse?&nbsp; Does
the Archbishop of Canterbury go to an inn, run up a reckoning,
and then say to his landlord, &ldquo;Mistress, I have no
coin?&rdquo;&nbsp; Assuredly the Dean has a purse, and a
tolerably well-filled one; and, assuredly, the Archbishop, on
departing from an inn, not only settles his reckoning, but leaves
something handsome for the servants, and does not say that he is
forbidden by the gospel to pay for what he has eaten, or the
trouble he has given, as a certain Spanish cavalier said he was
forbidden by the statutes of chivalry.&nbsp; Now, to take the
part of yourself, or the part of the <a name="page348"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 348</span>oppressed, with your fists, is quite
as lawful in the present day as it is to refuse your coat and
your shirt also to any vagabond who may ask for them, and not to
refuse to pay for supper, bed and breakfast, at the Feathers, or
any other inn, after you have had the benefit of all three.</p>
<p>The conduct of Lavengro with respect to drink may, upon the
whole, serve as a model.&nbsp; He is no drunkard, nor is he fond
of intoxicating other people; yet when the horrors are upon him
he has no objection to go to a public-house and call for a pint
of ale, nor does he shrink from recommending ale to others when
they are faint and downcast.&nbsp; In one instance, it is true,
he does what cannot be exactly justified; he encourages the
priest in the dingle, in more instances than one, in drinking
more hollands and water than is consistent with decorum.&nbsp; He
has a motive indeed in doing so; a desire to learn from the knave
in his cups the plans and hopes of the Propaganda of Rome.&nbsp;
Such conduct, however, was inconsistent with strict fair dealing
and openness; and the author advises all those whose consciences
never reproach them for a single unfair or covert act committed
by them, to abuse him heartily for administering hollands and
water to the Priest of Rome.&nbsp; In that instance the hero is
certainly wrong; yet in all other cases with regard to drink, he
is manifestly right.&nbsp; To tell people that they are never to
drink a glass of ale or wine themselves, or to give one to
others, is cant; and the writer has no toleration for cant of any
description.&nbsp; Some cants are not dangerous; but the writer
believes that a more dangerous cant than the temperance cant, or
as it is generally called, teetotalism, is scarcely to be
found.&nbsp; The writer is willing to believe that it originated
with well meaning, though weak people; but there can be no doubt
that it was quickly turned to account by people who were neither
well meaning nor weak.&nbsp; Let the reader note particularly the
purpose to which this cry has been turned in America&mdash;the
land, indeed, par excellence, of humbug and humbug cries.&nbsp;
It is there continually in the mouth of the most violent
political party, and is made an instrument of almost unexampled
persecution.&nbsp; The writer would say more on the temperance
cant, both in England and America, but want of space prevents
him.&nbsp; There is one point on which he cannot avoid making a
few brief remarks&mdash;that is, the inconsistent conduct of its
apostles in general.&nbsp; The teetotal apostle says, it is a
dreadful thing to be drunk.&nbsp; So it is, teetotaller; but if
so, why do you get drunk?&nbsp; I get drunk?&nbsp; Yes, unhappy
man, why do you get drunk on smoke and passion?&nbsp; Why are
your garments <a name="page349"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
349</span>impregnated with the odour of the Indian weed?&nbsp;
Why is there a pipe or a cigar always in your mouth?&nbsp; Why is
your language more dreadful than that of a Poissarde?&nbsp;
Tobacco-smoke is more deleterious than ale, teetotaller; bile
more potent than brandy.&nbsp; You are fond of telling your
hearers what an awful thing it is to die drunken.&nbsp; So it is,
teetotaller.&nbsp; Then take good care that you do not die with
smoke and passion, drunken, and with temperance language on your
lips; that is, abuse and calumny against all those who differ
from you.&nbsp; One word of sense you have been heard to say,
which is, that spirits may be taken as a medicine.&nbsp; Now you
are in a fever of passion, teetotaller: so, pray take this
tumbler of brandy; take it on the hom&oelig;opathic principle,
that heat is to be expelled by heat.&nbsp; You are in a
temperance fury, so swallow the contents of this tumbler, and it
will, perhaps, cure you.&nbsp; You look at the glass
wistfully&mdash;you say you occasionally take a glass
medicinally&mdash;and it is probable you do.&nbsp; Take one
now.&nbsp; Consider what a dreadful thing it would be to die
passion drunk; to appear before your Maker with intemperate
language on your lips.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right!&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t seem to wince at the brandy.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
right!&mdash;well done!&nbsp; All down in two pulls.&nbsp; Now
you look like a reasonable being!</p>
<p>If the conduct of Lavengro with regard to drink is open to
little censure, assuredly the use which he makes of his fists is
entitled to none at all.&nbsp; Because he has a pair of tolerably
strong fists, and knows to a certain extent how to use them, is
he a swaggerer or oppressor?&nbsp; To what ill account does he
turn them?&nbsp; Who more quiet, gentle and inoffensive than
he?&nbsp; He beats off a ruffian who attacks him in a dingle; has
a kind of friendly tuzzle with Mr. Petulengro, and behold the
extent of his fistic exploits.</p>
<p>Ay, but he associates with prize-fighters; and that very
fellow, Petulengro, is a prize-fighter, and has fought for a
stake in a ring.&nbsp; Well, and if he had not associated with
prize-fighters, how could he have used his fists?&nbsp; Oh,
anybody can use his fists in his own defence, without being
taught by prize-fighters.&nbsp; Can they?&nbsp; Then why does not
the Italian, or Spaniard, or Afghan use his fists when insulted
or outraged, instead of having recourse to the weapons which he
has recourse to?&nbsp; Nobody can use his fists without being
taught the use of them by those who have themselves been taught,
no more than any one can &ldquo;whiffle&rdquo; without being
taught by a master of the art.&nbsp; Now let any man of the
present day try to whiffle.&nbsp; Would not any one who wished to
<a name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 350</span>whiffle
have to go to a master of the art?&nbsp; Assuredly! but where
would he find one at the present day?&nbsp; The last of the
whifflers hanged himself about a fortnight ago on a bell-rope in
a church steeple of &ldquo;the old town,&rdquo; from pure grief
that there was no further demand for the exhibition of his art,
there being no demand for whiffling since the discontinuation of
Guildhall banquets.&nbsp; Whiffling is lost.&nbsp; The old chap
left his sword behind him; let any one take up the old
chap&rsquo;s sword and try to whiffle.&nbsp; Now much the same
hand as he would make who should take up the whiffler&rsquo;s
sword and try to whiffle, would he who should try to use his
fists who had never had the advantage of a master.&nbsp; Let no
one think that men use their fists naturally in their own
disputes&mdash;men have naturally recourse to any other thing to
defend themselves or to offend others; they fly to the stick, to
the stone, to the murderous and cowardly knife, or to abuse as
cowardly as the knife, and occasionally more murderous.&nbsp; Now
which is best when you hate a person, or have a pique against a
person, to clench your fist and say &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; or to
have recourse to the stone, the knife, or murderous
calumny?&nbsp; The use of the fist is almost lost in
England.&nbsp; Yet are the people better than they were when they
knew how to use their fists?&nbsp; The writer believes not.&nbsp;
A fisty combat is at present a great rarity, but the use of the
knife, the noose, and of poison, to say nothing of calumny, are
of more frequent occurrence in England than perhaps in any
country in Europe.&nbsp; Is polite taste better than when it
could bear the details of a fight?&nbsp; The writer believes
not.&nbsp; Two men cannot meet in a ring to settle a dispute in a
manly manner without some trumpery local newspaper letting loose
a volley of abuse against &ldquo;the disgraceful
exhibition,&rdquo; in which abuse it is sure to be sanctioned by
its dainty readers; whereas some murderous horror, the discovery
for example of the mangled remains of a woman in some obscure
den, is greedily seized hold on by the moral journal, and dressed
up for its readers, who luxuriate and gloat upon the ghastly
dish.&nbsp; Now, the writer of <i>Lavengro</i> has no sympathy
with those who would shrink from striking a blow, but would not
shrink from the use of poison or calumny; and his taste has
little in common with that which cannot tolerate the hardy
details of a prize-fight, but which luxuriates on descriptions of
the murder dens of modern England.&nbsp; But prize-fighters and
pugilists are blackguards, a reviewer has said; and blackguards
they would be provided they employed their skill and their
prowess for purposes of brutality and oppression; but
prize-fighters and pugilists are seldom friends <a
name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 351</span>to
brutality and oppression; and which is the blackguard, the writer
would ask: he who uses his fists to take his own part, or
instructs others to use theirs for the same purpose, or the being
who from envy and malice, or at the bidding of a malicious
scoundrel, endeavours by calumny, falsehood, and
misrepresentation to impede the efforts of lonely and unprotected
genius?</p>
<p>One word more about the race, all but extinct, of the people
opprobriously called prize-fighters.&nbsp; Some of them have been
as noble, kindly men as the world ever produced.&nbsp; Can the
rolls of the English aristocracy exhibit names belonging to more
noble, more heroic men than those who were called respectively
Pearce, Cribb and Spring?&nbsp; Did ever one of the English
aristocracy contract the seeds of fatal consumption by rushing up
the stairs of a burning edifice, even to the topmost garret, and
rescuing a woman from seemingly inevitable destruction?&nbsp; The
writer says no.&nbsp; A woman was rescued from the top of a
burning house; but the man who rescued her was no aristocrat; it
was Pearce, not Percy, who ran up the burning stairs.&nbsp; Did
ever one of those glittering ones save a fainting female from the
libidinous rage of six ruffians?&nbsp; The writer believes
not.&nbsp; A woman was rescued from the libidinous fury of six
monsters on &mdash; Down; but the man who rescued her was no
aristocrat; it was Pearce not Paulet, who rescued the woman, and
thrashed my Lord&rsquo;s six gamekeepers&mdash;Pearce, whose
equal never was, and probably never will be, found in sturdy
combat.&nbsp; Are there any of the aristocracy of whom it can be
said that they never did a cowardly, cruel or mean action, and
that they invariably took the part of the unfortunate and weak
against cruelty and oppression?&nbsp; As much can be said of
Cribb, of Spring, and the other; but where is the aristocrat of
whom as much can be said?&nbsp; Wellington?&nbsp; Wellington
indeed! a skilful general, and a good man of valour, it is true,
but with that cant word of &ldquo;duty&rdquo; continually on his
lips.&nbsp; Did he rescue Ney from his butchers?&nbsp; Did he
lend a helping hand to Warner?</p>
<p>In conclusion, the writer would advise those of his
country-folks who read his book to have nothing to do with the
two kinds of canting nonsense described above, but in their
progress through life to enjoy as well as they can, but always
with moderation, the good things of this world, to put confidence
in God, to be as independent as possible, and to take their own
parts.&nbsp; If they are low spirited, let them not make
themselves foolish by putting on sackcloth, drinking water, or
chewing ashes, but let them take wholesome exercise, and eat the
most generous food they can get, taking up and reading
occasionally, not the lives of Ignatius Loyola <a
name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 352</span>and Francis
Spira, but something more agreeable; for example, the life and
adventures of Mr. Duncan Campbell, the deaf and dumb gentleman;
the travels of Captain Falconer in America, and the journal of
John Randall, who went to Virginia and married an Indian wife;
not forgetting, amidst their eating and drinking, their walks
over heaths, and by the sea-side, and their agreeable literature,
to be charitable to the poor, to read the Psalms and to go to
church twice on a Sunday.&nbsp; In their dealings with people, to
be courteous to everybody, as Lavengro was, but always
independent like him; and if people meddle with them, to give
them as good as they bring, even as he and Isopel Berners were in
the habit of doing; and it will be as well for him to observe
that he by no means advises women to be too womanly, but bearing
the conduct of Isopel Berners in mind, to take their own parts,
and if anybody strikes them, to strike again.</p>
<p>Beating of women by the lords of the creation has become very
prevalent in England since pugilism has been
discountenanced.&nbsp; Now the writer strongly advises any woman
who is struck by a ruffian to strike him again; or if she cannot
clench her fists, and he advises all women in these singular
times to learn to clench their fists, to go at him with tooth and
nail, and not to be afraid of the result, for any fellow who is
dastard enough to strike a woman, would allow himself to be
beaten by a woman, were she to make at him in self-defence, even
if, instead of possessing the stately height and athletic
proportions of the aforesaid Isopel, she were as diminutive in
stature, and had a hand as delicate, and foot as small, as a
certain royal lady, who was some time ago assaulted by a fellow
upwards of six feet high, whom the writer has no doubt she could
have beaten had she thought proper to go at him.&nbsp; Such is
the deliberate advice of the author to his countrymen and
women&mdash;advice in which he believes there is nothing
unscriptural or repugnant to common sense.</p>
<p>The writer is perfectly well aware that, by the plain language
which he has used in speaking of the various kinds of nonsense
prevalent in England, he shall make himself a multitude of
enemies; but he is not going to conceal the truth or to tamper
with nonsense, from the fear of provoking hostility.&nbsp; He has
a duty to perform and he will perform it resolutely; he is the
person who carried the Bible to Spain; and as resolutely as he
spoke in Spain against the superstitions of Spain, will he speak
in England against the nonsense of his own native land.&nbsp; He
is not one of those who, before they sit down to write a book,
say to themselves, what cry shall we take up? what principles
shall we advocate? what principles <a name="page353"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 353</span>shall we abuse? before we put pen to
paper we must find out what cry is the loudest, what principle
has the most advocates, otherwise, after having written our book,
we may find ourselves on the weaker side.</p>
<p>A sailor of the <i>Bounty</i> waked from his sleep by the
noise of the mutiny, lay still in his hammock for some time,
quite undecided whether to take part with the captain or to join
the mutineers.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must mind what I do,&rdquo; said he
to himself, &ldquo;lest, in the end, I find myself on the weaker
side;&rdquo; finally, on hearing that the mutineers were
successful, he went on deck, and seeing Bligh pinioned to the
mast, he put his fist to his nose, and otherwise insulted
him.&nbsp; Now, there are many writers of the present day whose
conduct is very similar to that of the sailor.&nbsp; They lie
listening in their corners till they have ascertained which
principle has most advocates; then, presently, they make their
appearance on the deck of the world with their book; if truth has
been victorious, then has truth their hurrah! but if truth is
pinioned against the mast, then is their fist thrust against the
nose of truth, and their gibe and their insult spurted in their
face.&nbsp; The strongest party had the sailor, and the strongest
party has almost invariably the writer of the present day.</p>

354</span>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">PSEUDO-CRITICS.</span></h3>
<p>A <span class="smcap">certain</span> set of individuals
calling themselves critics have attacked <i>Lavengro</i> with
much virulence and malice.&nbsp; If what they call criticism had
been founded on truth, the author would have had nothing to
say.&nbsp; The book contains plenty of blemishes, some of them,
by-the-bye, wilful ones, as the writer will presently show; not
one of these, however, has been detected and pointed out; but the
best passages in the book, indeed whatever was calculated to make
the book valuable, have been assailed with abuse and
misrepresentation.&nbsp; The duty of the true critic is to play
the part of a leech, and not of a viper.&nbsp; Upon true and upon
malignant criticism there is an excellent fable by the Spaniard
Iriarte.&nbsp; The viper says to the leech, &ldquo;Why do people
invite your bite, and flee from mine?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; says the leech, &ldquo;people receive
health from my bite, and poison from yours.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is as much difference,&rdquo; says the clever
Spaniard, &ldquo;between true and malignant criticism, as between
poison and medicine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Certainly a great many
meritorious writers have allowed themselves to be poisoned by
malignant criticism; the writer, however, is not one of those who
allow themselves to be poisoned by pseudo-critics; no! no! he
will rather hold them up by their tails, and show the creatures
wriggling, blood and foam streaming from their broken jaws.&nbsp;
First of all, however, he will notice one of their
objections.&nbsp; &ldquo;The book isn&rsquo;t true,&rdquo; say
they.&nbsp; Now one of the principal reasons with those who have
attacked <i>Lavengro</i> for their abuse of it is, that it is
particularly true in one instance, namely, that it exposes their
own nonsense, their love of humbug, their slavishness, their
dressings, their goings out, their scraping and bowing to great
people; it is the showing up of &ldquo;gentility nonsense&rdquo;
in <i>Lavengro</i> that has been one principal reason for the
raising the above cry; for in <i>Lavengro</i>, is denounced the
besetting folly of the English people, a folly which those who
call themselves guardians of the public taste are far from being
above.&nbsp; &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t abide anything that
isn&rsquo;t true!&rdquo; they exclaim.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t
they?&nbsp; Then why are they so enraptured with any fiction that
is adapted to purposes of humbug, which tends to make them
satisfied with their own proceedings, <a name="page355"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 355</span>with their own nonsense, which does
not tell them to reform, to become more alive to their own
failings, and less sensitive about the tyrannical goings on of
the masters, and the degraded condition, the sufferings, and the
trials of the serfs in the star Jupiter?&nbsp; Had
<i>Lavengro</i>, instead of being the work of an independent
mind, been written in order to further any of the thousand and
one cants, and species of nonsense prevalent in England, the
author would have heard much less about its not being true, both
from public detractors and private censurers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>Lavengro</i> pretends to be an
autobiography,&rdquo; say the critics; and here the writer begs
leave to observe, that it would be well for people who profess to
have a regard for truth, not to exhibit in every assertion which
they make a most profligate disregard of it; this assertion of
theirs is a falsehood, and they know it to be a falsehood.&nbsp;
In the preface <i>Lavengro</i> is stated to be a dream; and the
writer takes this opportunity of stating that he never said it
was an autobiography; never authorised any person to say that it
was one; and that he has in innumerable instances declared in
public and private, both before and after the work was published,
that it was not what is generally termed an autobiography: but a
set of people who pretend to write criticisms on books, hating
the author for various reasons&mdash;amongst others, because,
having the proper pride of a gentleman and a scholar, he did not,
in the year &rsquo;43, choose to permit himself to be exhibited
and made a zany of in London, and especially because he will
neither associate with, nor curry favour with, them who are
neither gentlemen nor scholars&mdash;attack his book with abuse
and calumny.&nbsp; He is, perhaps, condescending too much when he
takes any notice of such people; as, however, the English public
is wonderfully led by cries and shouts, and generally ready to
take part against any person who is either unwilling or unable to
defend himself, he deems it advisable not to be altogether quiet
with those who assail him.&nbsp; The best way to deal with vipers
is to tear out their teeth; and the best way to deal with
pseudo-critics is to deprive them of their poison-bag, which is
easily done by exposing their ignorance.&nbsp; The writer knew
perfectly well the description of people with whom he would have
to do, he therefore very quietly prepared a stratagem, by means
of which he could at any time exhibit them, powerless and
helpless, in his hand.&nbsp; Critics, when they review books,
ought to have a competent knowledge of the subjects which those
books discuss.</p>
<p><i>Lavengro</i> is a philological book, a poem if you choose
to call it so.&nbsp; Now what a fine triumph it would have been
for those <a name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
356</span>who wished to vilify the book and its author, provided
they could have detected the latter tripping in his
philology&mdash;they might have instantly said that he was an
ignorant pretender to philology&mdash;they laughed at the idea of
his taking up a viper by its tail, a trick which hundreds of
country urchins do every September, but they were silent about
the really wonderful part of the book, the philological
matter&mdash;they thought philology was his stronghold, and that
it would be useless to attack him there; they of course would
give him no credit as a philologist, for anything like fair
treatment towards him was not to be expected at their hands, but
they were afraid to attack his philology&mdash;yet that was the
point, and the only point in which they might have attacked him
successfully; he was vulnerable there.&nbsp; How was this?&nbsp;
Why, in order to have an opportunity of holding up pseudo-critics
by the tails, he wilfully spelt various foreign words
wrong&mdash;Welsh words, and even Italian words&mdash;did they
detect these mis-spellings? not one of them, even as he knew they
would not, and he now taunts them with ignorance; and the power
of taunting them with ignorance is the punishment which he
designed for them&mdash;a power which they might but for their
ignorance have used against him.&nbsp; The writer besides knowing
something of Italian and Welsh, knows a little of Armenian
language and literature; but who knowing anything of the Armenian
language, unless he had an end in view, would say, that the word
for sea in Armenian is anything like the word tide in
English?&nbsp; The word for sea in Armenian is <i>dzow</i>, a
word connected with the Tibetian word for water, and the Chinese
<i>shuy</i>, and the Turkish <i>su</i>, signifying the same
thing; but where is the resemblance between <i>dzow</i> and
tide?&nbsp; Again, the word for bread in ancient Armenian is
<i>hats</i>; yet the Armenian on London Bridge is made to say
<i>zhats</i>, which is not the nominative of the Armenian noun
for bread, but the accusative: now, critics, ravening against a
man because he is a gentleman and a scholar, and has not only the
power but also the courage to write original works, why did not
you discover that weak point?&nbsp; Why, because you were
ignorant, so here ye are held up!&nbsp; Moreover, who with a name
commencing with Z, ever wrote fables in Armenian?&nbsp; There are
two writers of fables in Armenian&mdash;Varthan and Koscht, and
illustrious writers they are, one in the simple, and the other in
the ornate style of Armenian composition, but neither of their
names begins with a Z.&nbsp; Oh, what a precious opportunity ye
lost, ye ravening crew, of convicting the poor, half-starved,
friendless boy of the book, of ignorance or misrepresentation, by
asking who with a name beginning with Z <a
name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 357</span>ever wrote
fables in Armenian; but ye couldn&rsquo;t help yourselves, ye are
duncie.&nbsp; &ldquo;We duncie!&rdquo;&nbsp; Ay, duncie.&nbsp; So
here ye are held up by the tails, blood and foam streaming from
your jaws.</p>
<p>The writer wishes to ask here, what do you think of all this,
<i>Messieurs les Critiques</i>?&nbsp; Were ye ever served so
before?&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t you richly deserve it?&nbsp;
Haven&rsquo;t you been for years past bullying and insulting
everybody whom you deemed weak, and currying favour with
everybody whom you thought strong?&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>We</i> approve
of this.&nbsp; We disapprove of that.&nbsp; Oh, this will never
do.&nbsp; These are fine lines!&rdquo;&nbsp; The lines perhaps
some horrid sycophantic rubbish addressed to Wellington, or Lord
So-and-so.&nbsp; To have your ignorance thus exposed, to be shown
up in this manner, and by whom?&nbsp; A gypsy!&nbsp; Ay, a gypsy
was the very right person to do it.&nbsp; But is it not galling,
after all?</p>
<p>Ah, but <i>we</i> don&rsquo;t understand Armenian, it cannot
be expected that <i>we</i> should understand Armenian, or Welsh,
or&mdash;.&nbsp; Hey, what&rsquo;s this?&nbsp; The mighty
<i>we</i> not understand Armenian or Welsh, or&mdash;.&nbsp; Then
why does the mighty <i>we</i> pretend to review a book like
<i>Lavengro</i>?&nbsp; From the arrogance with which it
continually delivers itself, one would think that the mighty
<i>we</i> is omniscient; that it understands every language; is
versed in every literature; yet the mighty <i>we</i> does not
even know the word for bread in Armenian.&nbsp; It knows bread
well enough by name in English, and frequently bread in England
only by its name, but the truth is, that the mighty <i>we</i>,
with all its pretension, is in general a very sorry creature,
who, instead of saying <i>nous disons</i>, should rather say
<i>nous dis</i>: Parny in his <i>Guerre des Dieux</i>, very
profanely makes the three in one say, <i>Je faisons</i>; now,
Lavengro, who is anything but profane, would suggest that
critics, especially magazine and Sunday newspaper critics, should
commence with <i>nous dis</i>, as the first word would be
significant of the conceit and assumption of the critic, and the
second of the extent of the critic&rsquo;s information.&nbsp; The
<i>we</i> says its say, but when fawning sycophancy or vulgar
abuse are taken from that say, what remains?&nbsp; Why a blank, a
void, like Ginnungagap.</p>
<p>As the writer, of his own accord, has exposed some of the
blemishes of his book&mdash;a task, which a competent critic
ought to have done&mdash;he will now point out two or three of
its merits, which any critic, not altogether blinded with
ignorance, might have done, or not replete with gall and envy
would have been glad to do.&nbsp; The book has the merit of
communicating a fact connected with physiology, which in all the
pages of the multitude of books was never previously
mentioned&mdash;the mysterious practice <a
name="page358"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 358</span>of touching
objects to baffle the evil chance.&nbsp; The miserable detractor
will, of course, instantly begin to rave about such a habit being
common: well and good; but was it ever before described in print,
or all connected with it dissected?&nbsp; He may then vociferate
something about Johnson having touched: the writer cares not
whether Johnson, who, by-the-bye, during the last twenty or
thirty years, owing to people having become ultra Tory mad from
reading Scott&rsquo;s novels and the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, has
been a mighty favourite, especially with some who were in the
habit of calling him a half crazy old fool&mdash;touched, or
whether he did or not; but he asks where did Johnson ever
describe the feelings which induced him to perform the magic
touch, even supposing that he did perform it?&nbsp; Again, the
history gives an account of a certain book called the <i>Sleeping
Bard</i>, the most remarkable prose work of the most difficult
language but one, of modern Europe,&mdash;a book, for a notice of
which, he believes, one might turn over in vain the pages of any
review printed in England, or, indeed, elsewhere.&nbsp; So here
are two facts, one literary and the other physiological, for
which any candid critic was bound to thank the author, even as in
<i>the Romany Rye</i> there is a fact connected with Iro-Norman
Myth, for the disclosing of which, any person who pretends to
have a regard for literature is bound to thank him, namely, that
the mysterious Finn or Fingal of <i>Ossian&rsquo;s Poems</i> is
one and the same person as the Sigurd Fafnisbane of the Edda and
the Wilkina, and the Siegfried Horn of the Lay of the
Niebelungs.</p>
<p>The writer might here conclude, and, he believes, most
triumphantly; as, however, he is in the cue for writing, which he
seldom is, he will for his own gratification, and for the sake of
others, dropping metaphors about vipers and serpents, show up in
particular two or three sets or cliques of people, who, he is
happy to say, have been particularly virulent against him and his
work, for nothing indeed could have given him greater
mortification than their praise.</p>
<p>In the first place, he wishes to dispose of certain
individuals who call themselves men of wit and
fashion&mdash;about town&mdash;who he is told have abused his
book &ldquo;vaustly&rdquo;&mdash;their own word.&nbsp; These
people paint their cheeks, wear white kid gloves, and dabble in
literature, or what they conceive to be literature.&nbsp; For
abuse from such people, the writer was prepared.&nbsp; Does any
one imagine that the writer was not well aware, before he
published his book, that, whenever he gave it to the world, he
should be attacked by every literary coxcomb in England who had
influence <a name="page359"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
359</span>enough to procure the insertion of a scurrilous article
in a magazine or newspaper!&nbsp; He has been in Spain, and has
seen how invariably the mule attacks the horse; now why does the
mule attack the horse?&nbsp; Why, because the latter carries
about with him that which the envious hermaphrodite does not
possess.</p>
<p>They consider, forsooth, that his book is low&mdash;but he is
not going to waste words about them&mdash;one or two of whom, he
is told, have written very duncie books about Spain, and are
highly enraged with him, because certain books which he wrote
about Spain were not considered duncie.&nbsp; No, he is not going
to waste words upon them, for verily he dislikes their company,
and so he&rsquo;ll pass them by, and proceed to others.</p>
<p>The Scotch Charlie o&rsquo;er the water people have been very
loud in the abuse of <i>Lavengro</i>&mdash;this again might be
expected; the sarcasms of the priest about the Charlie o&rsquo;er
the water nonsense of course stung them.&nbsp; Oh! it is one of
the claims which <i>Lavengro</i> has to respect, that it is the
first, if not the only work, in which that nonsense is, to a
certain extent, exposed.&nbsp; Two or three of their remarks on
passages of <i>Lavengro</i>, he will reproduce and laugh
at.&nbsp; Of course your Charlie o&rsquo;er the water people are
genteel exceedingly, and cannot abide anything low.&nbsp;
Gypsyism they think is particularly low, and the use of gypsy
words in literature beneath its gentility; so they object to
gypsy words being used in <i>Lavengro</i> where gypsies are
introduced speaking&mdash;&ldquo;What is Romany forsooth?&rdquo;
say they.&nbsp; Very good!&nbsp; And what is Scotch? has not the
public been nauseated with Scotch for the last thirty
years?&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, but Scotch is not&rdquo;&mdash;the writer
believes he knows much better than the Scotch what Scotch is and
what it is not; he has told them before what it is: a very sorry
jargon.&nbsp; He will now tell them what it is not&mdash;a sister
or an immediate daughter of the Sanscrit, which Romany is.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ay, but the Scotch are&rdquo;&mdash;foxes, foxes, nothing
else than foxes, even like the gypsies&mdash;the difference
between the gypsy and Scotch fox being that the first is wild,
with a mighty brush, the other a sneak with a gilt collar and
without a tail.</p>
<p>A Charlie o&rsquo;er the water person attempts to be witty,
because the writer has said that perhaps a certain old Edinburgh
High-School porter, of the name of Boee, was perhaps of the same
blood as a certain Bui, a Northern Kemp who distinguished himself
at the battle of Horinger Bay.&nbsp; A pretty matter, forsooth,
to excite the ridicule of a Scotchman!&nbsp; Why, is there a
beggar or trumpery fellow in Scotland, who does not pretend to be
somebody, or related to somebody?&nbsp; Is not every Scotchman <a
name="page360"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 360</span>descended
from some king, kemp or cow-stealer of old, by his own account at
least?&nbsp; Why, the writer would even go so far as to bet a
trifle that the poor creature, who ridicules Boee&rsquo;s
supposed ancestry, has one of his own, at least as grand and as
apocryphal as old Boee&rsquo;s of the High School.</p>
<p>The same Charlie o&rsquo;er the water person is mightily
indignant that Lavengro should have spoken disrespectfully of
William Wallace; Lavengro, when he speaks of that personage,
being a child of about ten years old, and repeating merely what
he had heard.&nbsp; All the Scotch, by-the-bye, for a great many
years past, have been great admirers of William Wallace,
particularly the Charlie o&rsquo;er the water people, who in
their nonsense-verses about Charlie generally contrive to bring
in the name of William, Willie, or Wullie, Wallace.&nbsp; The
writer begs leave to say that he by no means wishes to bear hard
against William Wallace, but he cannot help asking why, if
William, Willie, or Wullie, Wallace was such a particularly nice
person, did his brother Scots betray him to a certain renowned
southern warrior, called Edward Longshanks, who caused him to be
hanged and cut into four in London, and his quarters to be placed
over the gates of certain towns?&nbsp; They got gold, it is true,
and titles, very nice things, no doubt; but, surely, the life of
a patriot is better than all the gold and titles in the
world&mdash;at least Lavengro thinks so&mdash;but Lavengro has
lived more with gypsies than Scotchmen, and gypsies do not betray
their brothers.&nbsp; It would be some time before a gypsy would
hand over his brother to the harum-beck, even supposing you would
not only make him a king, but a justice of the peace, and not
only give him the world, but the best farm on the Holkham estate;
but gypsies are wild foxes, and there is certainly a wonderful
difference between the way of thinking of the wild fox who
retains his brush, and that of the scurvy kennel creature who has
lost his tail.</p>
<p>Ah! but thousands of Scotch, and particularly the Charlie
o&rsquo;er the water people, will say, &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t
sell Willie Wallace, it was our forbears who sold Willie
Wallace&mdash;&nbsp; If Edward Longshanks had asked us to sell
Wullie Wallace, we would soon have shown him
that&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Lord better ye, ye poor trumpery set of
creatures, ye would not have acted a bit better than your
forefathers; remember how ye have ever treated the few amongst ye
who, though born in the kennel, have shown something of the
spirit of the wood.&nbsp; Many of ye are still alive who
delivered over men, quite as honest and patriotic as William
Wallace, into the hands of an English minister, to be chained and
transported for merely <a name="page361"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 361</span>venturing to speak and write in the
cause of humanity, at the time when Europe was beginning to fling
off the chains imposed by kings and priests.&nbsp; And it is not
so very long since Burns, to whom ye are now building up obelisks
rather higher than he deserves, was permitted by his countrymen
to die in poverty and misery, because he would not join with them
in songs of adulation to kings and the trumpery great.&nbsp; So
say not that ye would have acted with respect to William Wallace
one whit better than your fathers&mdash;and you in particular, ye
children of Charlie, whom do ye write nonsense-verses
about?&nbsp; A family of dastard despots, who did their best,
during a century and more, to tread out the few sparks of
independent feeling still glowing in Scotland&mdash;but enough
has been said about ye.</p>
<p>Amongst those who have been prodigal in abuse and defamation
of <i>Lavengro</i>, have been your modern Radicals, and
particularly a set of people who filled the country with noise
against the King and Queen, Wellington, and the Tories, in
&rsquo;32.&nbsp; About these people the writer will presently
have occasion to say a good deal, and also of real
Radicals.&nbsp; As, however, it may be supposed that he is one of
those who delight to play the sycophant to kings and queens, to
curry favour with Tories, and to bepraise Wellington, he begs
leave to state that such is not the case.</p>
<p>About kings and queens he has nothing to say; about Tories,
simply that he believes them to be a bad set; about Wellington,
however, it will be necessary for him to say a good deal, of
mixed import, as he will subsequently frequently have occasion to
mention him in connection with what he has to say about
pseudo-Radicals.</p>
<h3><a name="page362"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
362</span>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">PSEUDO-RADICALS.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">About</span> Wellington, then, he says,
that he believes him at the present day to be infinitely
overrated.&nbsp; But there certainly was a time when he was
shamefully underrated.&nbsp; Now what time was that?&nbsp; Why
the time of pseudo-Radicalism, par excellence, from &rsquo;20 to
&rsquo;32.&nbsp; Oh, the abuse that was heaped on Wellington by
those who traded in Radical cant&mdash;your newspaper editors and
review writers! and how he was sneered at then by your Whigs, and
how faintly supported he was by your Tories, who were half
ashamed of him; for your Tories, though capital fellows as
followers, when you want nobody to back you, are the faintest
creatures in the world when you cry in your agony, &ldquo;Come
and help me!&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh, assuredly Wellington was infamously
used at that time, especially by your traders in Radicalism, who
howled at and hooted him; said he had every vice&mdash;was no
general&mdash;was beaten at Waterloo&mdash;was a
poltroon&mdash;moreover a poor illiterate creature, who could
scarcely read or write; nay, a principal Radical paper said
boldly he could not read, and devised an ingenious plan for
teaching Wellington how to read.&nbsp; Now this was too bad; and
the writer, being a lover of justice, frequently spoke up for
Wellington, saying, that as for vice, he was not worse than his
neighbours; that he was brave; that he won the fight at Waterloo,
from a half-dead man, it is true, but that he did win it.&nbsp;
Also, that he believed he had read <i>Rules for the Manual and
Platoon Exercises</i> to some purpose; moreover, that he was sure
he could write, for that he the writer had once written to
Wellington, and had received an answer from him; nay, the writer
once went so far as to strike a blow for Wellington; for the last
time he used his fists was upon a Radical sub-editor, who was
mobbing Wellington in the street, from behind a rank of grimy
fellows.&nbsp; But though the writer spoke up for Wellington to a
certain extent when he was shamefully underrated, and once struck
a blow for him when he was about being hustled, he is not going
to join in the loathsome sycophantic nonsense which it has been
the fashion to use with respect to Wellington these last twenty
years.&nbsp; Now what have those years been to England!&nbsp; Why
the years of ultra-gentility, everybody in England having gone
gentility mad during the last twenty years, and no people more so
than your pseudo-Radicals.&nbsp; Wellington <a
name="page363"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 363</span>was turned
out, and your Whigs and Radicals got in, and then commenced the
period of ultra-gentility in England.&nbsp; The Whigs and
Radicals only hated Wellington as long as the patronage of the
country was in his hands, none of which they were tolerably sure
he would bestow on them; but no sooner did they get it into their
own, than they forthwith became admirers of Wellington.&nbsp; And
why?&nbsp; Because he was a duke, petted at Windsor and by
foreign princes, and a very genteel personage.&nbsp; Formerly
many of your Whigs and Radicals had scarcely a decent coat on
their backs; but now the plunder of the country was at their
disposal, and they had as good a chance of being genteel as any
people.&nbsp; So they were willing to worship Wellington because
he was very genteel, and could not keep the plunder of the
country out of their hands.&nbsp; And Wellington has been
worshipped, and prettily so, during the last fifteen or twenty
years.&nbsp; He is now a noble fine-hearted creature; the
greatest general the world ever produced; the bravest of men;
and&mdash;and&mdash;mercy upon us! the greatest of military
writers!&nbsp; Now the present writer will not join in such
sycophancy.&nbsp; As he was not afraid to take the part of
Wellington when he was scurvily used by all parties, and when it
was dangerous to take his part, so he is not afraid to speak the
naked truth about Wellington in these days, when it is dangerous
to say anything about him but what is sycophantically
laudatory.&nbsp; He said in &rsquo;32, that as to vice,
Wellington was not worse than his neighbours; but he is not going
to say in &rsquo;54, that Wellington was a noble-hearted fellow;
for he believes that a more cold-hearted individual never
existed.&nbsp; His conduct to Warner, the poor Vaudois, and
Marshal Ney, showed that.&nbsp; He said in &rsquo;32, that he was
a good general and a brave man; but he is not going, in
&rsquo;54, to say that he was the best general, or the bravest
man, the world ever saw.&nbsp; England has produced a better
general&mdash;France two or three&mdash;both countries many
braver men.&nbsp; The son of the Norfolk clergyman was a brave
man; Marshal Ney was a braver man.&nbsp; Oh, that battle of
Copenhagen!&nbsp; Oh, that covering the retreat of the Grand
Army!&nbsp; And though he said in &rsquo;32 that he could write,
he is not going to say in &rsquo;54 that he is the best of all
military writers.&nbsp; On the contrary, he does not hesitate to
say that any Commentary of Julius C&aelig;sar, or any chapter in
Justinus, more especially the one about the Parthians, is worth
the ten volumes of Wellington&rsquo;s Despatches; though he has
no doubt that, by saying so, he shall especially rouse the
indignation of a certain newspaper, at present one of the most
genteel journals imaginable&mdash;with a slight tendency to
liberalism, it is true, but <a name="page364"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 364</span>perfectly genteel&mdash;which is
nevertheless the very one which, in &rsquo;32, swore bodily that
Wellington could neither read nor write and devised an ingenious
plan for teaching him how to read.</p>
<p>Now, after the above statement, no one will venture to say, if
the writer should be disposed to bear hard upon Radicals, that he
would be influenced by a desire to pay court to princes, or to
curry favour with Tories, or from being a blind admirer of the
Duke of Wellington; but the writer is not going to declaim
against Radicals, that is, real Republicans, or their principles;
upon the whole, he is something of an admirer of both.&nbsp; The
writer has always had as much admiration for everything that is
real and honest as he has had contempt for the opposite.&nbsp;
Now real Republicanism is certainly a very fine thing, a much
finer thing than Toryism, a system of common robbery, which is
nevertheless far better than Whiggism <a
name="citation364"></a><a href="#footnote364"
class="citation">[364]</a>&mdash;a compound of petty larceny,
popular instruction, and receiving of stolen goods.&nbsp; Yes,
real Republicanism is certainly a very fine thing, and your real
Radicals and Republicans are certainly very fine fellows, or
rather were fine fellows, for the Lord only knows where to find
them at the present day&mdash;the writer does not.&nbsp; If he
did, he would at any time go five miles to invite one of them to
dinner, even supposing that he had to go to a workhouse in order
to find the person he wished to invite.&nbsp; Amongst the real
Radicals of England, those who flourished from the year &rsquo;16
to &rsquo;20, there were certainly extraordinary characters, men
partially insane, perhaps, but honest and brave&mdash;they did
not make a market of the principles which they professed, and
never intended to do so; they believed in them, and were willing
to risk their lives in endeavouring to carry them out.&nbsp; The
writer wishes to speak in particular of two of these men, both of
whom perished on the scaffold&mdash;their names were Thistlewood
and Ings.&nbsp; <a name="page365"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
365</span>Thistlewood, the best known of them, was a brave
soldier and had served with distinction as an officer in the
French service; he was one of the excellent swordsmen of Europe;
had fought several duels in France, where it is no child&rsquo;s
play to fight a duel; but had never unsheathed his sword for
single combat, but in defence of the feeble and insulted&mdash;he
was kind and open-hearted, but of too great simplicity; he had
once ten thousand pounds left him, all of which he lent to a
friend, who disappeared and never returned him a penny.&nbsp;
Ings was an uneducated man, of very low stature, but amazing
strength and resolution; he was a kind husband and father, and
though a humble butcher, the name he bore was one of the royal
names of the heathen Anglo-Saxons.&nbsp; These two men, along
with five others, were executed, and their heads hacked off, for
levying war against George the Fourth; the whole seven dying in a
manner which extorted cheers from the populace, the most of them
uttering philosophical or patriotic sayings.&nbsp; Thistlewood,
who was, perhaps, the most calm and collected of all, just before
he was turned off, said, &ldquo;We are now going to discover the
great secret&rdquo;.&nbsp; Ings, the moment before he was choked,
was singing &ldquo;Scots wha hae wi&rsquo; Wallace
bled.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now there was no humbug about those men, nor
about many more of the same time and of the same
principles.&nbsp; They might be deluded about Republicanism, as
Algernon Sidney was, and as Brutus was, but they were as honest
and brave as either Brutus or Sidney, and as willing to die for
their principles.&nbsp; But the Radicals who succeeded them were
beings of a very different description; they jobbed and traded in
Republicanism, and either parted with it, or at the present day
are eager to part with it, for a consideration.&nbsp; In order to
get the Whigs into power, and themselves places, they brought the
country by their inflammatory language to the verge of a
revolution, and were the cause that many perished on the
scaffold; by their incendiary harangues and newspaper articles
they caused the Bristol conflagration, for which six poor
creatures were executed; they encouraged the mob to pillage, pull
down and burn, and then rushing into garrets looked on.&nbsp;
Thistlewood tells the mob the Tower is a second Bastile; let it
be pulled down.&nbsp; A mob tries to pull down the Tower; but
Thistlewood is at the head of that mob; he is not peeping from a
garret on Tower Hill like Gulliver at Lisbon.&nbsp; Thistlewood
and Ings say to twenty ragged individuals, Liverpool and
Castlereagh are two satellites of despotism; it would be highly
desirable to put them out of the way.&nbsp; And a certain number
of ragged individuals are surprised in a stable in <a
name="page366"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 366</span>Cato
Street, making preparations to put Castlereagh and Liverpool out
of the way, and are fired upon with muskets by Grenadiers, and
are hacked at with cutlasses by Bow Street runners; but the twain
who encouraged those ragged individuals to meet in Cato Street
are not far off, they are not on the other side of the river, in
the Borough, for example, in some garret or obscure cellar.&nbsp;
The very first to confront the Guards and runners are Thistlewood
and Ings; Thistlewood whips his long thin rapier through
Smithers&rsquo; lungs, and Ings makes a dash at Fitzclarence with
his butcher&rsquo;s knife.&nbsp; Oh, there was something in those
fellows! honesty and courage; but can as much be said for the
inciters of the troubles of &rsquo;32?&nbsp; No; they egged on
poor ignorant mechanics and rustics, and got them hanged for
pulling down and burning, whilst the highest pitch to which their
own daring ever mounted was to mob Wellington as he passed in the
streets.</p>
<p>Now, these people were humbugs, which Thistlewood and Ings
were not.&nbsp; They raved and foamed against kings, queens,
Wellington, the aristocracy, and what not, till they had got the
Whigs into power, with whom they were in secret alliance, and
with whom they afterwards openly joined in a system of robbery
and corruption, more flagitious than the old Tory one, because
there was more cant about it; for themselves they got
consulships, commissionerships, and in some instances
governments; for their sons clerkships in public offices; and
there you may see those sons with the never-failing badge of the
low scoundrel-puppy, the gilt chain at the waistcoat-pocket; and
there you may hear and see them using the languishing tones, and
employing the airs and graces which wenches use and employ, who,
without being in the family way, wish to make their keepers
believe that they are in the family way.&nbsp; Assuredly great is
the cleverness of your Radicals of &rsquo;32, in providing for
themselves and their families.&nbsp; Yet, clever as they are,
there is one thing they cannot do&mdash;they get governments for
themselves, commissionerships for their brothers, clerkships for
their sons, but there is one thing beyond their craft&mdash;they
cannot get husbands for their daughters, who, too ugly for
marriage, and with their heads filled with the nonsense they have
imbibed from gentility-novels, go over from Socinus to the Pope,
becoming sisters in fusty convents, or having heard a few sermons
in Mr. Platitude&rsquo;s &ldquo;chapelle,&rdquo; seek for
admission at the establishment of mother S&mdash;, who, after
employing them for a time in various menial offices, and making
them pluck off their eyebrows, hair by hair, generally dismisses
them on the plea of sluttishness; whereupon they return to their
<a name="page367"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 367</span>papas to
eat the bread of the country, with the comfortable prospect of
eating it still in the shape of a pension after their sires are
dead.&nbsp; Papa (<i>ex uno disce omnes</i>) living as quietly as
he can; not exactly enviably, it is true, being now and then seen
to cast an uneasy and furtive glance behind, even as an animal is
wont, who has lost by some mischance a very sightly appendage; as
quietly however as he can, and as dignifiedly, a great admirer of
every genteel thing and genteel personage, the Duke in
particular, whose <i>Despatches</i>, bound in red morocco, you
will find on his table.&nbsp; A disliker of coarse expressions,
and extremes of every kind, with a perfect horror for revolutions
and attempts to revolutionise, exclaiming now and then, as a
shriek escapes from whipped and bleeding Hungary, a groan from
gasping Poland, and a half-stifled curse from down-trodden but
scowling Italy, &ldquo;Confound the revolutionary
<i>canaille</i>, why can&rsquo;t it be quiet!&rdquo; in a word,
putting one in mind of the <i>parvenu</i> in the <i>Walpurgis
Nacht</i>.&nbsp; The writer is no admirer of Goethe, but the idea
of that <i>parvenu</i> was certainly a good one&mdash;yes,
putting one in mind of the individual who says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Wir waren wahrlich auch nicht dumm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Und thaten oft was wir nicht sollten;<br />
Doch jetzo kehrt sich alles um und um,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Und eben da wir&rsquo;s fest erhalten
wollten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were no fools, as every one discern&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And stopp&rsquo;d at nought our projects in
fulfilling;<br />
But now the world seems topsy-turvy turn&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To keep it quiet just when we were willing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, this class of individuals entertain a mortal hatred for
<i>Lavengro</i> and its writer, and never lose an opportunity of
vituperating both.&nbsp; It is true that such hatred is by no
means surprising.&nbsp; There is certainly a great deal of
difference between Lavengro and their own sons; the one thinking
of independence and philology, whilst he is clinking away at
kettles, and hammering horse-shoes in dingles; the others stuck
up at public offices with gilt chains at their waistcoat-pockets,
and giving themselves the airs and graces of females of a certain
description.&nbsp; And there certainly <i>is</i> a great deal of
difference between the author of <i>Lavengro</i> and
themselves&mdash;he retaining his principles and his brush; they
with scarlet breeches on, it is true, but without their
republicanism and their tails.&nbsp; Oh, the writer can well
afford to be vituperated by your pseudo-Radicals of
&rsquo;32!</p>
<p>Some time ago the writer was set upon by an old Radical and
his wife; but the matter is too rich not to require a chapter to
itself.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE OLD RADICAL.</span></h3>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This very dirty man, with his very dirty
face,<br />
Would do any dirty act, which would get him a place.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> time ago the writer was set
upon by an old Radical and his wife; but before he relates the
manner in which they set upon him, it will be as well to enter
upon a few particulars tending to elucidate their reasons for so
doing.</p>
<p>The writer had just entered into his eighteenth year, when he
met at the table of a certain Anglo-Germanist an individual,
apparently somewhat under thirty, of middle stature, a thin and
weaselly figure, a sallow complexion, a certain obliquity of
vision, and a large pair of spectacles.&nbsp; This person, who
had lately come from abroad, and had published a volume of
translations, had attracted some slight notice in the literary
world, and was looked upon as a kind of lion in a small
provincial capital.&nbsp; After dinner he argued a great deal,
spoke vehemently against the Church, and uttered the most
desperate Radicalism that was perhaps ever heard, saying, he
hoped that in a short time there would not be a king or queen in
Europe, and inveighing bitterly against the English aristocracy,
and against the Duke of Wellington in particular, whom he said,
if he himself was ever president of an English republic&mdash;an
event which he seemed to think by no means improbable&mdash;he
would hang for certain infamous acts of profligacy and bloodshed
which he had perpetrated in Spain.&nbsp; Being informed that the
writer was something of a philologist, to which character the
individual in question laid great pretensions, he came and sat
down by him, and talked about languages and literature.&nbsp; The
writer, who was only a boy, was a little frightened at first,
but, not wishing to appear a child of absolute ignorance, he
summoned what little learning he had, and began to blunder out
something about the Celtic languages and their literature, and
asked the Lion who he conceived Finn Ma Coul to be? and whether
he did not consider the &ldquo;Ode to the Fox,&rdquo; by Red Rhys
of Eryry, to be a masterpiece of pleasantry?&nbsp; Receiving no
answer to these questions from the Lion, who, singular enough, <a
name="page369"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 369</span>would
frequently, when the writer put a question to him, look across
the table, and flatly contradict some one who was talking to some
other person, the writer dropped the Celtic languages and
literature, and asked him whether he did not think it a funny
thing that Temugin, generally called Genghis Khan, should have
married the daughter of Prester John? <a
name="citation369"></a><a href="#footnote369"
class="citation">[369]</a>&nbsp; The Lion, after giving a
side-glance at the writer through his left spectacle glass,
seemed about to reply, but was unfortunately prevented, being
seized with an irresistible impulse to contradict a respectable
doctor of medicine, who was engaged in conversation with the
master of the house at the upper and farther end of the table,
the writer being a poor ignorant lad, sitting of course at the
bottom.&nbsp; The doctor, who had served in the Peninsula, having
observed that Ferdinand the Seventh was not quite so bad as had
been represented, the Lion vociferated that he was ten times
worse, and that he hoped to see him and the Duke of Wellington
hanged together.&nbsp; The doctor, who, being a Welshman, was
somewhat of a warm temper, growing rather red, said that at any
rate he had been informed that Ferdinand the Seventh knew
sometimes how to behave himself like a gentleman&mdash;this
brought on a long dispute, which terminated rather
abruptly.&nbsp; The Lion having observed that the doctor must not
talk about Spanish matters with one who had visited every part of
Spain, the doctor bowed, and said he was right, for that he
believed no people in general possessed such accurate information
about countries as those who had travelled them as bagmen.&nbsp;
On the Lion asking the doctor what he meant, the Welshman, whose
under jaw began to move violently, replied, that he meant what he
said.&nbsp; Here the matter ended, for the Lion turning from him,
looked at the writer.&nbsp; The writer, imagining that his own
conversation hitherto had been too trivial and common-place for
the Lion to consider it worth his while to take much notice of
it, determined to assume a little higher ground, and after
repeating a few verses of the Koran, and gabbling a little
Arabic, asked the Lion what he considered to be the difference
between the Hegira and the Christian era, adding, that he thought
the general computation was in error by about one year; and being
a particularly modest person, chiefly, he believes, owing to his
having been at school in Ireland, absolutely blushed at finding
that the Lion returned not a word in answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a
wonderful individual I am seated by,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;to
whom Arabic seems a vulgar speech, and a question about the
Hegira not worthy of <a name="page370"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 370</span>an answer!&rdquo; not reflecting
that as lions come from the Sahara, they have quite enough of
Arabic at home, and that the question about the Hegira was rather
<i>mal &agrave; propos</i> to one used to prey on the flesh of
hadjis.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now I only wish he would vouchsafe me a
little of his learning,&rdquo; thought the boy to himself, and in
this wish he was at last gratified; for the Lion, after asking
him whether he was acquainted at all with the Sclavonian
languages, and being informed that he was not, absolutely
dumb-foundered him by a display of Sclavonian erudition.</p>
<p>Years rolled by&mdash;the writer was a good deal about,
sometimes in London, sometimes in the country, sometimes abroad;
in London he occasionally met the man of the spectacles, who was
always very civil to him, and, indeed, cultivated his
acquaintance.&nbsp; The writer thought it rather odd that, after
he himself had become acquainted with the Sclavonian languages
and literature, the man of the spectacles talked little or
nothing about them.&nbsp; In a little time, however, the matter
ceased to cause him the slightest surprise, for he had discovered
a key to the mystery.&nbsp; In the meantime the man of spectacles
was busy enough; he speculated in commerce, failed, and paid his
creditors twenty pennies in the pound; published translations, of
which the public at length became heartily tired; having, indeed,
got an inkling of the manner in which those translations were got
up.&nbsp; He managed, however, to ride out many a storm, having
one trusty sheet-anchor&mdash;Radicalism.&nbsp; This he turned to
the best advantage&mdash;writing pamphlets and articles in
reviews, all in the Radical interest, and for which he was paid
out of the Radical fund; which articles and pamphlets, when
Toryism seemed to reel on its last legs, exhibited a slight
tendency to Whiggism.&nbsp; Nevertheless, his abhorrence of
desertion of principle was so great in the time of the Duke of
Wellington&rsquo;s administration, that when S&mdash; left the
Whigs and went over, he told the writer, who was about that time
engaged with him in a literary undertaking, that the said
S&mdash; was a fellow with a character so infamous, that any
honest man would rather that you should spit in his face than
insult his ears with the mention of the name of S&mdash;.</p>
<p>The literary project having come to nothing,&mdash;in which,
by-the-bye, the writer was to have all the labour, and his friend
all the credit, provided any credit should accrue from
it,&mdash;the writer did not see the latter for some years,
during which time considerable political changes took place; the
Tories were driven from, and the Whigs placed in, office, both
events being brought about by the Radicals coalescing with the
Whigs, over whom they <a name="page371"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 371</span>possessed great influence for the
services which they had rendered.&nbsp; When the writer next
visited his friend, he found him very much altered; his opinions
were by no means so exalted as they had been&mdash;he was not
disposed even to be rancorous against the Duke of Wellington,
saying that there were worse men than he, and giving him some
credit as a general; a hankering after gentility seeming to
pervade the whole family, father and sons, wife and daughters,
all of whom talked about genteel
diversions&mdash;gentility-novels, and even seemed to look with
favour on high Churchism, having in former years, to all
appearance, been bigoted Dissenters.&nbsp; In a little time the
writer went abroad; as, indeed, did his friend; not, however,
like the writer, at his own expense, but at that of the
country&mdash;the Whigs having given him a travelling
appointment, which he held for some years, during which he is
said to have received upwards of twelve thousand pounds of the
money of the country, for services which will, perhaps, be found
inscribed on certain tablets, when another Astolfo shall visit
the moon.&nbsp; This appointment, however, he lost on the Tories
resuming power&mdash;when the writer found him almost as Radical
and patriotic as ever, just engaged in trying to get into
Parliament, into which he got by the assistance of his Radical
friends, who, in conjunction with the Whigs, were just getting up
a crusade against the Tories, which they intended should be a
conclusive one.</p>
<p>A little time after the publication of <i>The Bible in
Spain</i>, the Tories being still in power, this individual, full
of the most disinterested friendship for the author, was
particularly anxious that he should be presented with an official
situation, in a certain region a great many miles off.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are the only person for that appointment,&rdquo; said
he; &ldquo;you understand a great deal about the country, and are
better acquainted with the two languages spoken there than any
one in England.&nbsp; Now I love my country, and have, moreover,
a great regard for you, and as I am in Parliament, and have
frequent opportunities of speaking to the Ministry, I shall take
care to tell them how desirable it would be to secure your
services.&nbsp; It is true they are Tories, but I think that even
Tories would give up their habitual love of jobbery in a case
like yours, and for once show themselves disposed to be honest
men and gentlemen; indeed, I have no doubt they will; for, having
so deservedly an infamous character, they would be glad to get
themselves a little credit, by a presentation which could not
possibly be traced to jobbery or favouritism.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
writer begged his friend to give himself no trouble about the
matter, as he was not desirous of the appointment, being in
tolerably <a name="page372"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
372</span>easy circumstances, and willing to take some rest after
a life of labour.&nbsp; All, however, that he could say was of no
use, his friend indignantly observing that the matter ought to be
taken entirely out of his hands, and the appointment thrust upon
him for the credit of the country.&nbsp; &ldquo;But may not many
people be far more worthy of the appointment than myself?&rdquo;
said the writer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; said the friendly
Radical.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t get it, it will be made
a job of, given to the son of some steward, or, perhaps, to some
quack who has done dirty work; I tell you what, I shall ask it
for you, in spite of you; I shall, indeed!&rdquo; and his eyes
flashed with friendly and patriotic fervour through the large
pair of spectacles which he wore.</p>
<p>And, in fact, it would appear that the honest and friendly
patriot put his threat into execution.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
spoken,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;more than once to this and that
individual in Parliament, and everybody seems to think that the
appointment should be given to you.&nbsp; Nay, that you should be
forced to accept it.&nbsp; I intend next to speak to Lord
A&mdash;.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="citation372a"></a><a
href="#footnote372a" class="citation">[372a]</a>&nbsp; And so he
did, at least it would appear so.&nbsp; On the writer calling
upon him one evening, about a week afterwards, in order to take
leave of him, as the writer was about to take a long journey for
the sake of his health, his friend no sooner saw him than he
started up in a violent fit of agitation, and glancing about the
room, in which there were several people, amongst others two Whig
members of Parliament, said: &ldquo;I am glad you are come, I was
just speaking about you.&nbsp; This,&rdquo; said he, addressing
the two members, &ldquo;is so-and-so, the author of so-and-so,
the well-known philologist; as I was telling you, I spoke to Lord
A&mdash; <a name="citation372b"></a><a href="#footnote372b"
class="citation">[372b]</a> this day about him, and said that he
ought forthwith to have the head appointment in &mdash;; and what
did the fellow say?&nbsp; Why, that there was no necessity for
such an appointment at all, and if there were, why&mdash;and then
he hummed and ha&rsquo;d.&nbsp; Yes,&rdquo; said he, looking at
the writer, &ldquo;he did indeed.&nbsp; What a scandal! what an
infamy!&nbsp; But I see how it will be, it will be a job.&nbsp;
The place will be given to some son of a steward or to some
quack, as I said before.&nbsp; Oh, these Tories!&nbsp; Well, if
this does not make one&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Here he stopped short,
crunched his teeth, and looked the image of desperation.</p>
<p>Seeing the poor man in this distressed condition, the writer
begged him to be comforted, and not to take the matter so much to
heart; but the indignant Radical took the matter very much to
heart, and refused all comfort whatever, bouncing about the room,
<a name="page373"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 373</span>and,
whilst his spectacles flashed in the light of four spermaceti
candles, exclaiming: &ldquo;It will be a job&mdash;a Tory
job!&nbsp; I see it all, I see it all, I see it all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And a job it proved, and a very pretty job, but no Tory
job.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards the Tories were out, and the Whigs
were in.&nbsp; From that time the writer heard not a word about
the injustice done to the country, in not presenting him with the
appointment to &mdash;; the Radical, however, was busy enough to
obtain the appointment, not for the writer, but for himself and
eventually succeeded, partly through Radical influence, and
partly through that of a certain Whig lord, for whom the Radical
had done, on a particular occasion, work of a particular
kind.&nbsp; So, though the place was given to a quack, and the
whole affair a very pretty job, it was one in which the Tories
had certainly no hand.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, however, the friendly Radical did not drop
the writer.&nbsp; Oh, no!&nbsp; On various occasions he obtained
from the writer all the information about the country in
question, and was particularly anxious to obtain from the writer,
and eventually did obtain, a copy of a work written in the court
language of that country, edited by the writer, a language
exceedingly difficult, which the writer, at the expense of a
considerable portion of his eyesight, had acquired, at least as
far as by the eyesight it could be acquired.&nbsp; What use the
writer&rsquo;s friend made of the knowledge he had gained from
him, and what use he made of the book, the writer can only guess;
but he has little doubt that when the question of sending a
person to &mdash; was mooted in a Parliamentary
Committee&mdash;which it was at the instigation of the Radical
supporters of the writer&rsquo;s friend&mdash;the Radical on
being examined about the country, gave the information which he
had obtained from the writer as his own, and flashed the book and
its singular characters in the eyes of the Committee; and then of
course his Radical friends would instantly say: &ldquo;This is
the man! there is no one like him.&nbsp; See what information he
possesses; and see that book written by himself in the court
language of Serendib.&nbsp; This is the only man to send
there.&nbsp; What a glory, what a triumph it would be to Britain,
to send out a man so deeply versed in the mysterious lore of
&mdash;, as our illustrious countryman; a person who with his
knowledge could beat with their own weapons the wise men of
&mdash;!&nbsp; Is such an opportunity to be lost?&nbsp; Oh, no,
surely not; if it is, it will be an eternal disgrace to England,
and the world will see that Whigs are no better than
Tories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let no one think the writer uncharitable in these
suppositions.&nbsp; The writer is only too well acquainted with
the antecedents of <a name="page374"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
374</span>the individual, to entertain much doubt that he would
shrink from any such conduct, provided he thought that his
temporal interest would be forwarded by it.&nbsp; The writer is
aware of more than one instance in which he has passed off the
literature of friendless young men for his own, after making them
a slight pecuniary compensation and deforming what was originally
excellent by interpolations of his own.&nbsp; This was his
especial practice with regard to translation, of which he would
fain be esteemed the king.&nbsp; This Radical <i>literato</i> is
slightly acquainted with four or five of the easier dialects of
Europe, on the strength of which knowledge he would fain pass for
a universal linguist, publishing translations of pieces
originally written in various difficult languages; which
translations, however, were either made by himself from literal
renderings done for him into French or German, or had been made
from the originals into English, by friendless young men, and
then deformed by his alterations.</p>
<p>Well, the Radical got the appointment, and the writer
certainly did not grudge it him.&nbsp; He, of course, was aware
that his friend had behaved in a very base manner towards him,
but he bore him no ill-will, and invariably when he heard him
spoken against, which was frequently the case, took his part when
no other person would; indeed, he could well afford to bear him
no ill-will.&nbsp; He had never sought for the appointment, nor
wished for it, nor, indeed, ever believed himself to be qualified
for it.&nbsp; He was conscious, it is true, that he was not
altogether unacquainted with the language and literature of the
country with which the appointment was connected.&nbsp; He was
likewise aware that he was not altogether deficient in courage
and in propriety of behaviour.&nbsp; He knew that his appearance
was not particularly against him, his face not being like that of
a convicted pickpocket, nor his gait resembling that of a fox who
has lost his tail; yet he never believed himself adapted for the
appointment, being aware that he had no aptitude for the doing of
dirty work, if called to do it, nor pliancy which would enable
him to submit to scurvy treatment, whether he did dirty work or
not&mdash;requisites, at the time of which he is speaking,
indispensable in every British official; requisites, by-the-bye,
which his friend, the Radical, possessed in a high degree; but
though he bore no ill-will towards his friend, his friend bore
anything but good-will towards him; for from the moment that he
had obtained the appointment for himself, his mind was filled
with the most bitter malignity against the writer, and naturally
enough; for no one ever yet behaved in a base manner towards
another, without forthwith conceiving a mortal hatred against
him.&nbsp; <a name="page375"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
375</span>You wrong another, know yourself to have acted basely,
and are enraged, not against yourself&mdash;for no one hates
himself&mdash;but against the innocent cause of your baseness;
reasoning very plausibly, &ldquo;But for that fellow, I should
never have been base; for had he not existed, I could not have
been so, at any rate against him&rdquo;; and this hatred is all
the more bitter, when you reflect that you have been needlessly
base.</p>
<p>Whilst the Tories are in power the writer&rsquo;s friend, of
his own accord, raves against the Tories because they do not give
the writer a certain appointment, and makes, or says he makes,
desperate exertions to make them do so; but no sooner are the
Tories out, with whom he has no influence, and the Whigs in, with
whom he, or rather his party, has influence, than he gets the
place for himself, though, according to his own expressed
opinion&mdash;an opinion with which the writer does not, and
never did, concur&mdash;the writer was the only person competent
to hold it.&nbsp; Now had he, without saying a word to the
writer, or about the writer with respect to the employment, got
the place for himself when he had an opportunity, knowing, as he
very well knew, himself to be utterly unqualified for it, the
transaction, though a piece of jobbery, would not have merited
the title of a base transaction; as the matter stands, however,
who can avoid calling the whole affair not only a piece
of&mdash;come, come, out with the word&mdash;scoundrelism on the
part of the writer&rsquo;s friend, but a most curious piece of
uncalled-for scoundrelism? and who, with any knowledge of fallen
human nature, can wonder at the writer&rsquo;s friend
entertaining towards him a considerable portion of gall and
malignity?</p>
<p>This feeling on the part of the writer&rsquo;s friend was
wonderfully increased by the appearance of <i>Lavengro</i>, many
passages of which the Radical in his foreign appointment applied
to himself and family&mdash;one or two of his children having
gone over to Popery, the rest become members of Mr.
Platitude&rsquo;s chapel, and the minds of all being filled with
ultra notions of gentility.</p>
<p>The writer, hearing that his old friend had returned to
England, to apply, he believes, for an increase of salary, and
for a title, called upon him, unwillingly, it is true, for he had
no wish to see a person for whom, though he bore him no ill-will,
he could not avoid feeling a considerable portion of contempt;
the truth is, that his sole object in calling was to endeavour to
get back a piece of literary property which his friend had
obtained from him many years previously, and which, though he had
frequently applied for it, he never could get back.&nbsp; Well,
the writer called; he did not get his property, which, indeed, he
had scarcely time to press for, <a name="page376"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 376</span>being almost instantly attacked by
his good friend and his wife&mdash;yes, it was then that the
author was set upon by an old Radical and his wife&mdash;the
wife, who looked the very image of shame and malignity, did not
say much, it is true, but encouraged her husband in all he
said.&nbsp; Both of their own accord introduced the subject of
<i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; The Radical called the writer a grumbler,
just as if there had ever been a greater grumbler than himself
until, by the means above described, he had obtained a place; he
said that the book contained a melancholy view of human
nature&mdash;just as if anybody could look in his face without
having a melancholy view of human nature.&nbsp; On the writer
quietly observing that the book contained an exposition of his
principles, the pseudo-Radical replied, that he cared nothing for
his principles&mdash;which was probably true, it not being likely
that he would care for another person&rsquo;s principles after
having shown so thorough a disregard for his own.&nbsp; The
writer said that the book, of course, would give offence to
humbugs; the Radical then demanded whether he thought him a
humbug&mdash;the wretched wife was the Radical&rsquo;s
protection, even as he knew she would be; it was on her account
that the writer did not kick his good friend; as it was, he
looked at him in the face and thought to himself, &ldquo;How is
it possible I should think you a humbug, when only last night I
was taking your part in a company in which everybody called you a
humbug?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Radical, probably observing something in the
writer&rsquo;s eye which he did not like, became all on a sudden
abjectly submissive, and, professing the highest admiration for
the writer, begged him to visit him in his government; this the
writer promised faithfully to do, and he takes the present
opportunity of performing his promise.</p>
<p>This is one of the pseudo-Radical calumniators of
<i>Lavengro</i> and its author; were the writer on his death-bed
he would lay his hand on his heart and say, that he does not
believe that there is one trait of exaggeration in the portrait
which he has drawn.&nbsp; This is one of the pseudo-Radical
calumniators of <i>Lavengro</i> and its author; and this is one
of the genus, who, after having railed against jobbery for
perhaps a quarter of a century, at present batten on large
official salaries which they do not earn.&nbsp; England is a
great country, and her interests require that she should have
many a well-paid official both at home and abroad; but will
England long continue a great country if the care of her
interests, both at home and abroad, is in many instances
intrusted to beings like him described above, whose only
recommendation for an official <a name="page377"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 377</span>appointment was that he was deeply
versed in the secrets of his party and of the Whigs?</p>
<p>Before he concludes, the writer will take the liberty of
saying of <i>Lavengro</i> that it is a book written for the
express purpose of inculcating virtue, love of country, learning,
manly pursuits, and genuine religion, for example, that of the
Church of England, and for awakening a contempt for nonsense of
every kind, and a hatred for priestcraft, more especially that of
Rome.</p>
<p>And in conclusion, with respect to many passages of his book
in which he has expressed himself in terms neither measured nor
mealy, he will beg leave to observe, in the words of a great
poet, who lived a profligate life, it is true, but who died a
sincere penitent&mdash;thanks, after God, to good Bishop
Burnet&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All this with indignation I have
hurl&rsquo;d<br />
At the pretending part of this proud world,<br />
Who, swollen with selfish vanity, devise<br />
False freedoms, formal cheats, and holy lies,<br />
Over their fellow fools to tyrannise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>3.&nbsp; The third and last <i>MS.</i> is complete, but varies
considerably from the printed text.&nbsp; <i>Romany</i> is
written with two <i>m</i>&rsquo;s, as in <i>Lavengro</i>
throughout; in the fourth verse it reads: &ldquo;In Rommany
<i>chib</i>:<i> chiv</i> lis <i>odoy</i> opr&eacute; <i>the
chik</i>&rdquo;; fourth line omits &ldquo;<i>and</i>&rdquo;; in
the fifth and sixth verses it gives &ldquo;<i>sorlo</i>&rdquo;
properly, instead of &ldquo;saulo&rdquo;; in seventh verse it
reads &ldquo;<i>his</i> wendror,&rdquo; and in the last,
&ldquo;<i>boshom-engro</i>&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<i>tawni</i>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>From all these variants it results that <i>MS.</i> No. 3
furnishes a better reading than the printed text.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Chapter V.&nbsp; How Miles watched the
Brazen-head, and in the end went away from his master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fryer Bacon, having performed many wonderful things by
his curious Art, was now sifting out <i>how he might wall England
with brass</i>; wherefore he and Fryer Bungy, when they had
raised the devil, bound him to a tree, for to make him tell them
how it might be performed.&nbsp; He told them that they should
make a <i>Brazen-head</i>, which (if they could watch it till it
spoke) would tell them how it might be done.&nbsp; The head was
made, and they watched till they could watch no longer.&nbsp; At
last Fryer Bungey persuaded Fryer Bacon to let his man Miles
watch while they slept; to which the Fryer agreed.&nbsp; Then
Miles was called, who undertook to awake them when the Head would
speak.&nbsp; So to sleep they went, and Miles expected some great
speech to come from the Head.&nbsp; At last the Head cryed,
&lsquo;<i>TIME IS</i>&rsquo;; at which Miles fell into a great
laughter, and made his scoffs and jears thereat.&nbsp; Then it
said, &lsquo;<i>TIME WAS</i>&rsquo;; but yet he would not awake
his master, counting them but silly and frivolous words.&nbsp;
Lastly, the Head said, &lsquo;<i>TIME IS PAST</i>&rsquo;; at
which words down it fell, and in falling made such a noise that
it awakened the two Fryers, and had almost affrighted poor Miles
out of his senses,&rdquo; etc.</p>

<p>Page <b>262</b>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wife selling&rdquo;: A very
common practice among a certain class, it seems, in England; and,
as this will hardly be credited in America, I will append some
extracts from the newspapers.&nbsp; The <i>Norfolk Chronicle</i>
of 5th May, 1894, says: &ldquo;The belief formerly prevailed,
especially among the rural population, that a man had a perfectly
legal right to sell his wife to another, provided he observed two
indispensable formalities.&nbsp; One was that he placed a
<i>halter</i> about her neck, and the other that he led her into
the market and publicly transferred her to the purchaser.&nbsp;
Numerous instances of these strange transactions have been
recorded.&nbsp; Our columns, on the 9th of February, 1805,
contained an account of the sale of a wife at Norwich.&nbsp; A
Kentish tailor, the affections and person of whose amiable spouse
had been jockeyed away by a neighbouring horse-dealer,
caparisoned her neck <a name="page384"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 384</span>with a halter and surrendered all
right and title to his virtuous rib, in consideration of the sum
of &pound;5.&nbsp; On the 2nd of May, 1823, a similar sale was
effected in this city.&nbsp; A man named Stebbings disposed of
his wile to a person named Turner for the sum of &pound;6
10s.&nbsp; The latter paid &pound;4 on account, took the woman
home, and brutally turned his lawful wife out of
doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The London <i>Daily Mail</i> of 1st March, 1899, prints the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very few people are aware that wives are literally sold
to-day in England.&nbsp; A very common error of the vulgar is
that a man by selling his wife releases himself from the marriage
contract as surely as if he were legally divorced.&nbsp; In
March, 1796, <i>The Times</i> announced the sale of a wife at
Sheffield for sixpence.&nbsp; A short time afterwards the same
journal calmly stated that the price of wives has risen in
Smithfield Market from half a guinea to three guineas and a
half!&nbsp; In 1803 a man led his wife, by a halter round her
neck, into the cattle market at Sheffield, and sold her for a
guinea, the purchaser leading away the woman to his home.&nbsp;
In 1820 a man named Brouchet hired a cattle-pen in the Canterbury
market, placed his wife in it, and ultimately sold her for
5s.&nbsp; Then wives began to increase in value, for soon
afterwards one was sold for &pound;15.&nbsp; This was followed by
a &lsquo;slump&rsquo;.&nbsp; In 1855 a man led his wife with a
halter round her waist into Derby marketplace and offered her for
sale, but all be could get for her was eighteen pence and a quart
of ale.&nbsp; In 1873 a husband left his home and creditors in
Belper for the liberty of America.&nbsp; The week after his
flight all his goods were put up for auction to satisfy his
debts.&nbsp; His wife claimed part of the money, and this being
refused she insisted on being offered for sale as part of her
husband&rsquo;s assets.&nbsp; There was no sale, however, for
&lsquo;Lot 29&rsquo;.&nbsp; In even more recent days wife sales
were common, and are even being effected in this present year of
grace.&nbsp; In 1882 John Wilson, a collier of Alfreton,
Derbyshire, sold his wife in a public-house for fourpence.&nbsp;
Sheffield knife-grinders have long been noted for their
transactions in the wife trade.&nbsp; Within quite recent times
many a Sheffield wife has been sold by her husband for a gallon
of beer, which has been drunk on the spot.&nbsp; Sometimes these
sales assume a more formal aspect.&nbsp; In 1887, in the
Sheffield County Court, a man admitted that he had bought another
man&rsquo;s wife for 5s.&nbsp; Most of these discreditable
&lsquo;deals&rsquo; escape notice, but a case has come to light
where a man agreed to sell his wife to a collier, and the trio,
with the woman&rsquo;s father and mother and two family friends,
assembled to arrange terms.&nbsp; Thirty shillings was the price
finally agreed on.&nbsp; Four years ago, at Leeds, a man charged
with bigamy pleaded that, as he had sold his wife for 3s. 6d. to
another man, he could marry again legally!&nbsp; Eighteen
months&rsquo; imprisonment was what he got, and more than
deserved.&nbsp; A police court case in 1896 at Doncaster revealed
the fact that John Tart sold his wife to Enoch Childs, on the
understanding that the latter reared the vendor&rsquo;s four
children.&nbsp; In a Durham court in 1894 it transpired that a
man named Shaw sold his daughter, a girl of sixteen, to a collier
called Cudman, for 1s.&nbsp; Many a wife is at present sold in
the East End of London, as well as in Yorkshire, for a quart of
beer or an ounce of thick twist.&nbsp; It is the poor man&rsquo;s
method of divorce, and such is popular ignorance that there are
scores of people who imagine that selling a wife is as legal a
separation as a <i>decree nisi</i> pronounced by a bewigged and
berobed judge.&rdquo;</p>

learned by Borrow in January, 1854, from his Irish guide Cronan,
while travelling in Cornwall (<i>Life</i>, ii., p. 86, and
note).&nbsp; This fact shows that Murtagh and his tale are
introduced here to exhibit the author&rsquo;s discovery of the
identity between the Finn of Ireland and the Eddaic tradition of
Sigurd Fafnisbane (p. 281).&nbsp; For Sigurd in the Wilkina Saga
is suckled by a hind (p. 120) and fostered by Mymmer Smed or
Mimer the Smith (p. 121) whom he eventually slays (p. 124).&nbsp;
In the Eddaic Lay of the serpent-killer we read: &ldquo;Sigurd
took the heart of Fafnir and broiled it on a spit.&nbsp; And when
he judged that it was done, he touched it with his finger to
ascertain if that were really the case.&nbsp; Having burned his
finger in the act, he put it to his mouth, and no sooner had the
heart&rsquo;s blood of Fafnir come in contact with Sigurd&rsquo;s
tongue than he understood the speech of birds,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp;
Here we have the two sides verified, the Irish by Cronan, and the
Scandian by the Edda.&nbsp; But Brooke&rsquo;s <i>Reliques</i>, a
favourite work of Borrow&rsquo;s in his Norwich days, and which
he cites in 1832 (<i>Life</i>, i., p. 146), give us certain other
fragments of these Finnic fables, whereby we can trace the
sources of the text before us.&nbsp; For example, after Jack Dale
had stripped Murtagh of all his money he is observed to be
sitting &ldquo;in deep despondency, holding his thumb to his
mouth&rdquo; (p. 278).&nbsp; And a little farther on (p. 282) a
verse is cited from &ldquo;Conan the Bald&rdquo;.&nbsp; Now all
this is found in Miss Brooke, that is, the names and the
ideas&mdash;Conan the Bald (p. 106), Lochlin (p. 46), and Darmod
Odeen (minus Taffy) and the verse with this note (p.
109):&mdash;&ldquo;This strange passage is explained by some
lines in the Poem of Dubmac-Dighruibh, where Finn is reproached
with deriving all his courage from <i>chewing his thumb</i> for
prophetic information.&rdquo;&mdash;<b>281</b>.&nbsp; <b>Siol
Loughlin</b>, read <i>Lochlin</i> (Ir.): Literally &ldquo;the
seed of Norway,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, the Danish or Norwegian
race.&nbsp; Miss Brooke very properly says (p. 46):
&ldquo;Lochlin is the G&aelig;lic (and Irish) name for
Scandinavia in general&rdquo;; but Borrow limits it to
Denmark&mdash;the Danish race.&nbsp; And a little below,
&ldquo;the Loughlin songs&rdquo; are his <i>Danish Ballads</i>
which he published the following year.</p>

<a name="page386"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 386</span>to reach

sea&rdquo;) that day.&nbsp; The next he came to Spalding, some
fifteen miles farther, where he met the recruiting serjeant,
thence on to Norwich by Lynn Regis.</p>
<p>We must not forget that before <i>Lavengro</i> was begun, and
fifteen years prior to the publication of <i>The Romany Rye</i>,
that is, 26th December, 1842, Mr. Petulengro remarked to George
Borrow at Oulton: &ldquo;I suppose you have not forgot how,
fifteen [seventeen] years ago, when you made horseshoes in the
dingle by the side of the great north road, I lent you fifty
guineas to purchase the wonderful trotting cob of the innkeeper
with the green Newmarket coat, which <i>three days after</i> you
sold for two hundred&rdquo;. <a name="citation386a"></a><a
href="#footnote386a" class="citation">[386a]</a>&nbsp; Now, this
is a very remarkable statement, and, taken in connection with the
fact that so little is said about Horncastle in the book, it
seems to me we are justified in proclaiming that Borrow was never
in Horncastle at all.&nbsp; The interview with the Magyar and the
syllabus of Hungarian history are clearly drawn from his
experiences in Hungary and Transylvania in the year 1844, and
hence are an anachronism here.&nbsp; It is a pity that the author
did not adhere to the chronological facts of his life so strictly
in <i>The Romany Rye</i> as he did in <i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp;
Truth and literature would have gained by it.&nbsp; And then that
valedictory pledge, <a name="citation386b"></a><a
href="#footnote386b" class="citation">[386b]</a> confirmed in the
appendix, drawing a veil over the period of his travails, if not
his travels, was an error of judgment which, in an autobiography
will, we fear, not easily be condoned.</p>

1548.&nbsp; Terrified by the menaces of the Church of Rome and
the prospective ruin of his family, he went to Venice and

to return home and repeat his abjuration before his
fellow-townsmen and the local authorities.&nbsp; Having performed
this act, he fell into the horrid state of <a

class="footnote">[320]</a>&nbsp; Genteel with them seems to be
synonymous with Gentile and Gentoo; if so, the manner in which it
has been applied for ages ceases to surprise, for genteel is
heathenish.&nbsp; Ideas of barbaric pearl and gold, glittering
armour, plumes, tortures, blood-shedding, and lust, should always
be connected with it.&nbsp; Wace, in his grand Norman poem, calls
the Baron Genteel:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;La furent li gentil Baron,&rdquo; etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he certainly could not have applied the word better than
to the strong Norman thief, armed cap-a-pie without one particle
of ruth or generosity; for a person to be a pink of gentility,
that is heathenism, should have no such feelings; and, indeed,
the admirers of gentility seldom or never associate any such
feelings with it.&nbsp; It was from the Norman, the worst of all
robbers and miscreants, who built strong castles, garrisoned them
with devils, and tore out poor wretches&rsquo; eyes, as the Saxon
Chronicle says, that the English got their detestable word
genteel.&nbsp; What could ever have made the English such
admirers of gentility, it would be difficult to say; for, during
three hundred years, they suffered enough by it.&nbsp; Their
genteel Norman landlords were their scourgers, their torturers,
the plunderers of their homes, the dishonourers of their wives,
and the deflowers of their daughters.&nbsp; Perhaps after all,
fear is at the root of the English veneration for gentility.</p>
<p><a name="footnote323"></a><a href="#citation323"
class="footnote">[323]</a>&nbsp; Gentle and gentlemanly may be
derived from the same root as genteel; but nothing can be more
distinct from the mere genteel, than the ideas which enlightened
minds associate with these words.&nbsp; Gentle and gentlemanly
mean something kind and genial; genteel, that which is glittering
or gaudy.&nbsp; A person can be a gentleman in rags, but nobody
can be genteel.</p>
<p><a name="footnote342"></a><a href="#citation342"
class="footnote">[342]</a>&nbsp; The writer has been checked in
print by the Scotch with being a Norfolk man.&nbsp; Surely,
surely, these latter times have not been exactly the ones in
which it was expedient for Scotchmen to check the children of any
county in England with the place of their birth, more especially
those who have had the honour of being born in
Norfolk&mdash;times in which British fleets, commanded by
Scotchmen, have returned laden with anything but laurels from
foreign shores.&nbsp; It would have been well for Britain had she
had the old Norfolk man to despatch to the Baltic or the black
Sea, lately, instead of Scotch admirals.</p>
<p><a name="footnote364"></a><a href="#citation364"
class="footnote">[364]</a>&nbsp; As the present work will come
out in the midst of a vehement political contest, people may be
led to suppose that the above was written expressly for the
time.&nbsp; The writer therefore begs to state that it was
written in the year 1854.&nbsp; He cannot help adding that he is
neither Whig, Tory, nor Radical, and cares not a straw what party
governs England, provided it is governed well.&nbsp; But he has
no hopes of good government from the Whigs.&nbsp; It is true that
amongst them there is one very great man, Lord Palmerston, who is
indeed the sword and buckler, the chariots and the horses of the
party; but it is impossible for his lordship to govern well with
such colleagues as he has&mdash;colleagues which have been forced
upon him by family influence, and who are continually pestering
him into measures anything but conducive to the country&rsquo;s
honour and interest.&nbsp; If Palmerston would govern well, he
must get rid of them; but from that step, with all his courage
and all his greatness, he will shrink.&nbsp; Yet how proper and
easy a step it would be!&nbsp; He could easily get better, but
scarcely worse, associates.&nbsp; They appear to have one object
in view and only one&mdash;jobbery.&nbsp; It was chiefly owing to
a most flagitious piece of jobbery, which one of his
lordship&rsquo;s principal colleagues sanctioned and promoted,
that his lordship experienced his late parliamentary
disasters.</p>

  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
